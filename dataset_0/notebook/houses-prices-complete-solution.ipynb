With this premise there is a plethora of available data, where we can highlight the data set of [Boston Housing](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston) from Harrison and Rubinfeld (1978) as the most famous for beginners and already much explored.\n\nBut after so many years would this data set present enough complexity and challenge for students to practice a whole range of new knowledge acquired in their courses in statistics and data science? Would it have a sufficient number of observations and features to make it necessary to analyze outliers, collinearity, multicollinearity, the need for selection and reduction of dimensionality of features, it to not mention its applicability to more modern machine learning techniques and algorithms?\n\nNot in the opinion of [Dr Dean De Cock](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dean-de-cock-b5336537/), Professor of Statistics at Truman State University. He was looking for a data set that would allow students the opportunity to display the skills they had learned within the class.\n\nIn his quest, he finally found with the Ames City Assessor's Office a potential data set. The initial Excel file contained 113 variables describing 3970 property sales that had occurred in Ames, Iowa between 2006 and 2010. The variables were a mix of nominal, ordinal, continuous, and discrete variables used in calculation of assessed values and included physical property measurements in addition to computation variables used in the city's assessment process. For Dr Dean purposes, a \"layman's\" data set that could be easily understood by users at all levels was desirable; so He began his project by removing any variables that required special knowledge or previous calculations for their use. Most of these deleted variables were related to weighting and adjustment factors used in the city's current modeling system. \n\nIn the end, the selected dataset has 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The case was so interesting that it was introduced as one of the competitions for beginners of Kaggle, quickly becoming one of the most popular. If you interest to get some insights and suggestions directly from Dr Dean before start, I recommend that you read his [paper](http://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf).\n\nWith this spirit, I create this material, not with the purpose of competing, but of intended to cover most of the techniques of data analysis in Python for regression analysis. That is why it follows the natural flow of ML and contains many texts and links to the techniques, made your conference and references easy. as it can be extended over time.\n\nIn order not to fall into monotony, sometimes I take some liberties and apply a little humor, but nothing that compromises the accuracy of knowledge that is being acquired by the reader. Of course, anyone who wants to contribute some addition or even a claim or choreography will be very welcome. But what should you be thinking now? So, enough of tangle and let's go.\n[![image](http://www.conradopaulinoadv.com.br/v2/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2-600x350.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdt13wtIlVs)\n__Competition Description__:\n\nWith 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) from Kaggle challenges you to predict the final price of each home.\n\nPractice Skills\n- Creative feature engineering \n- Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting\n\nFor a detailed description of the data set, click [here](../input/data_description.txt)."},{"metadata":{"toc":true,"_uuid":"4c54c14c82f318e63558071444d94541e3544f33"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1>Table of Contents<span class=\"tocSkip\"></span></h1>\n<div class=\"toc\"><ul class=\"toc-item\"><li><span><a href=\"#Preparing-environment-and-uploading-data\" data-toc-modified-id=\"Preparing-environment-and-uploading-data-1\"><span class=\"toc-item-num\">1&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Preparing environment and uploading data</a></span><ul class=\"toc-item\"><li><span><a href=\"#Import-Packages\" data-toc-modified-id=\"Import-Packages-1.1\"><span class=\"toc-item-num\">1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Import Packages</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"#Load-Datasets\" data-toc-modified-id=\"Load-Datasets-1.2\"><span class=\"toc-item-num\">1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Load Datasets</a></span></li></ul></li><li><span><a href=\"#Exploratory-Data-Analysis-(EDA)\" data-toc-modified-id=\"Exploratory-Data-Analysis-(EDA)-2\"><span class=\"toc-item-num\">2&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</a></span><ul class=\"toc-item\"><li><span><a href=\"#Take-a-First-Look-of-our-Data:\" data-toc-modified-id=\"Take-a-First-Look-of-our-Data:-2.1\"><span class=\"toc-item-num\">2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Take a First Look of our Data:</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"#Some-Observations-from-the-STR-Details:\" data-toc-modified-id=\"Some-Observations-from-the-STR-Details:-2.2\"><span class=\"toc-item-num\">2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Some Observations from the STR Details:</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"#First-see-of-some-stats-of-Numeric-Data\" data-toc-modified-id=\"First-see-of-some-stats-of-Numeric-Data-2.3\"><span class=\"toc-item-num\">2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>First see of some stats of Numeric Data</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"#Overall-Quality\" data-toc-modified-id=\"Overall-Quality-2.4\"><span class=\"toc-item-num\">2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Overall Quality</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"#Total-Rooms-above-Ground-and-Living-Area\" data-toc-modified-id=\"Total-Rooms-above-Ground-and-Living-Area-2.5\"><span class=\"toc-item-num\">2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Total Rooms above Ground and Living Area</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"#Garage-areas-and-parking\" data-toc-modified-id=\"Garage-areas-and-parking-2.6\"><span class=\"toc-item-num\">2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Garage areas and parking</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"#Total-Basement-Area-Vs-1st-Flor-Area\" data-toc-modified-id=\"Total-Basement-Area-Vs-1st-Flor-Area-2.7\"><span class=\"toc-item-num\">2.7&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Total Basement Area Vs 1st Flor Area</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"#Year-Built-Vs-Garage-Year-Built\" data-toc-modified-id=\"Year-Built-Vs-Garage-Year-Built-2.8\"><span class=\"toc-item-num\">2.8&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Year Built Vs Garage Year Built</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"#Bathrooms-Features\" data-toc-modified-id=\"Bathrooms-Features-2.9\"><span class=\"toc-item-num\">2.9&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Bathrooms Features</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"#Reviwe-Porch-Features:\" data-toc-modified-id=\"Reviwe-Porch-Features:-2.10\"><span class=\"toc-item-num\">2.10&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Reviwe Porch Features:</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"#Slope-of-property-and-Lot-area\" data-toc-modified-id=\"Slope-of-property-and-Lot-area-2.11\"><span class=\"toc-item-num\">2.11&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Slope of property and Lot area</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"#Neighborhood\" data-toc-modified-id=\"Neighborhood-2.12\"><span class=\"toc-item-num\">2.12&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Neighborhood</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"#Check-the-Dependent-Variable---SalePrice:\" data-toc-modified-id=\"Check-the-Dependent-Variable---SalePrice:-2.13\"><span class=\"toc-item-num\">2.13&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Check the Dependent Variable - SalePrice:</a></span></li><li><span><a href=\"#Test-hypothesis-of-better-feature:-Construction-Area\" data-toc-modified-id=\"Test-hypothesis-of-better-feature:-Construction-Area-2.14\"><span class=\"toc-item-num\">2.14&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Test hypothesis of better feature: Construction Area</a></span></li></ul></li><li><span><a href=\"#3.-Check-Data-Quality:\" data-toc-modified-id=\"3.-Check-Data-Quality:-3\"><span class=\"toc-item-num\">3&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>3.

Each observation in the categorical feature is thus converted into a vector of size m with only one of the values as 1 (indicating it as active). \n\nFrom sklearn in preprocessing you can use the  LabelEncoder to create a cod map for the category feature than use the OneHotEncoder to apply the one hot encode strategy above then. This is interesting for most real cases where your model will be applied to data that will be fed and updated continuously in a pipeline.\n\nAs our case is restricted to the data provided and it fits on a pandas data frame, we will make use of the function get_dummies from pandas, but attention this function does not transform the data to a vector as in the case of the previous or as in R.\n\nThe dummy coding scheme is similar to the one hot encoding scheme, except in the case of dummy coding scheme, when applied on a categorical feature with m distinct labels, we get m-1 binary features. Thus each value of the categorical variable gets converted into a vector of size m-1. The extra feature is completely disregarded and thus if the category values range from {0, 1, ..., m-1} the 0th or the m-1th feature is usually represented by a vector of all zeros (0)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"57756f1fdd984f31e1780daa72da39597ba23aac"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def one_hot_encode(df):\n    categorical_cols = df.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns\n\n    print(len(categorical_cols), \"categorical columns\")\n    print(categorical_cols)\n    # Remove special charactres and withe spaces. \n    for col in categorical_cols:\n        df[col] = df[col].str.replace('\\W', '').str.replace(' ', '_') #.str.lower()\n\n    dummies = pd.get_dummies(df[categorical_cols], columns = categorical_cols).columns\n    df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns = categorical_cols)\n\n    print(\"Total Columns:\",len(df.columns))\n    print(df.info())\n    \n    return df, dummies\n\n# Correct Categorical from int to str types\nall_data.MSSubClass = all_data.MSSubClass.astype('str')\nall_data.MoSold = all_data.MoSold.astype('str')\n\nall_data, dummies = one_hot_encode(all_data)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"511219c426d5ced28b34376872718d3eb5449aa8"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Removing Dummies with  none observations in train or test datasets\nThis is such a simple action, we often find it to be obvious, but note that few books or articles make them as standard.

To make matters worst multicollinearity can emerge even when isolated pairs of variables are not collinear.\n\nTo identify, we need start with the coefficient of determination, r<sup>2</sup>, is the square of the Pearson correlation coefficient r. The coefficient of determination, with respect to correlation, is the proportion of the variance that is shared by both variables. It gives a measure of the amount of variation that can be explained by the model (the correlation is the model). It is sometimes expressed as a percentage (e.g., 36% instead of 0.36) when we discuss the proportion of variance explained by the correlation. However, you should not write r<sup>2</sup> = 36%, or any other percentage. You should write it as a proportion (e.g., r<sup>2</sup> = 0.36).\n![image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQTS_TVxaBpLmAGthSUAS9w7SVKsmLOtocz7ts-MXioJwa-Se0U)\n\nAlready the **Variance Inflation Factor** (**VIF**) is a measure of collinearity among predictor variables within a multiple regression.  It is may be calculated for each predictor by doing a linear regression of that predictor on all the other predictors, and then obtaining the R<sup>2</sup> from that regression.  It is calculated by taking the the ratio of the variance of all a given model's betas divide by the variance of a single beta if it were fit alone [1/(1-R<sup>2</sup>)]. Thus, a VIF of 1.8 tells us that the variance (the square of the standard error) of a particular coefficient is 80% larger than it would be if that predictor was completely uncorrelated with all the other predictors. The VIF has a lower bound of 1 but no upper bound. Authorities differ on how high the VIF has to be to constitute a problem (e.g.: 2.50 (R<sup>2</sup> equal to 0.6), sometimes 5 (R<sup>2</sup> equal to .8), or greater than 10 (R<sup>2</sup> equal to 0.9) and so on). \n\nBut there are several situations in which multicollinearity can be safely ignored:\n\n - ***Interaction terms*** and ***higher-order terms*** (e.g., ***squared*** and ***cubed predictors***) ***are correlated*** with main effect terms because they include the main effects terms. **Ops!** Sometimes we use ***polynomials*** to solve problems, **indeed!** But keep calm, in these cases,  **standardizing** the predictors can **removed the multicollinearity**. \n - ***Indicator***, like ***dummy*** or ***one-hot-encode***, that represent a ***categorical variable with three or more categories***. If the proportion of cases in the reference category is small, the indicator will necessarily have high VIF's, even if the categorical is not associated with other variables in the regression model. But, you need check if some dummy is collinear or has multicollinearity with other features outside of their dummies.\n - ***Control feature** if the ***feature of interest*** **do not have high VIF's**. Here's the thing about multicollinearity: it's only a problem for the features that are **collinear**. It increases the standard errors of their coefficients, and it may make those coefficients unstable in several ways. But so long as the collinear feature are only used as control feature, and they are not collinear with your feature of interest, there's no problem. The coefficients of the features of interest are not affected, and the performance of the control feature as controls is not impaired.\n\nSo, generally, we could run the same model twice, once with severe multicollinearity and once with moderate multicollinearity. This provides a great head-to-head comparison and it reveals the classic effects of multicollinearity. However, when standardizing your predictors doesn't work, you can try other solutions such as:\n- removing highly correlated predictors\n- linearly combining predictors, such as adding them together\n- running entirely different analyses, such as partial least squares regression or principal components analysis\n\nWhen considering a solution, keep in mind that all remedies have potential drawbacks. If you can live with less precise coefficient estimates, or a model that has a high R-squared but few significant predictors, doing nothing can be the correct decision because it won't impact the fit.\n\nGiven the potential for correlation among the predictors, we'll have display the variance inflation factors (VIF), which indicate the extent to which multicollinearity is present in a regression analysis. Hence such variables need to be removed from the model. Deleting one variable at a time and then again checking the VIF for the model is the best way to do this.\n\nSo, I start the analysis already having removed the features with he highest collinearities and run VIF."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"0f5980d3fc4415549be6c48ec6093120b3de1852"},"cell_type":"code","source":"all_data.rename(columns={'2ndFlrSF':'SndFlrSF'}, inplace=True)\n\ndef VRF(predict, data, y):\n   \n    scale = StandardScaler(with_std=False)\n    df = pd.DataFrame(scale.fit_transform(data), columns= cols)\n    features = \"+\".join(cols)\n    df['SalePrice'] = y.values\n\n    # get y and X dataframes based on this regression:\n    y, X = dmatrices(predict + ' ~' + features, data = df, return_type='dataframe')\n\n   # Calculate VIF Factors\n    # For each X, calculate VIF and save in dataframe\n    vif = pd.DataFrame()\n    vif[\"VIF Factor\"] = [variance_inflation_factor(X.values, i) for i in range(X.shape[1])]\n    vif[\"features\"] = X.columns\n\n    # Inspect VIF Factors\n    display(vif.sort_values('VIF Factor'))\n    return vif\n\n# Remove the higest correlations and run a multiple regression\ncols = all_data.columns\ncols = cols.drop(['SalePrice'])\nvif = VRF('SalePrice', all_data.loc[all_data.SalePrice>0, cols], all_data.SalePrice[all_data.SalePrice>0])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"43a5781ab016d869c3a1dcebaf53a2966804c82b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From the results, I conclude that we need work in the features where's the VIF stated as inf.

If a factor has a significant effect on the average, because the variability is much larger, many factors will seem to have a stronger effect when the mean is larger. This is not due, however, to a true factor effect but rather to an increased amount of variability that affects all factor effect estimates when the mean gets larger. This will probably generate spurious interactions due to a non-constant variation, resulting in a **very complex model** with many **spurious** and **unrealistic** interactions.\n- **Normality is an important assumption for many statistical techniques**: such as individuals control charts, Cp/Cpk analysis, t-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA). A substantial departure from normality will bias your capability estimates.\n\nOne solution to this is to transform your data into normality using a [Box-Cox transformation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.boxcox.html) means that you are able to run a broader number of tests.\n\nAt the core of the Box Cox transformation is an exponent, lambda (λ), which varies from -5 to 5. All values of λ are considered and the optimal value for your data is selected; The 'optimal value' is the one which results in the best approximation of a normal distribution curve. The transformation of Y has the form:\n<a href=\"http://vitarts3.hospedagemdesites.ws/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/boxcox.png\"><img src=\"http://vitarts3.hospedagemdesites.ws/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/boxcox.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"222\" height=\"70\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13940\" /></a>\n\nThe scipy implementation proceeded with this formula, then you need before take care of negatives values if you have. A common technique for handling negative values is to add a constant value to the data prior to applying the log transform. The transformation is therefore log(Y+a) where a is the constant. Some people like to choose a so that min(Y+a) is a very small positive number (like 0.001). Others choose a so that min(Y+a) = 1. For the latter choice, you can show that a = b – min(Y), where b is either a small number or is 1.\nThis test only works for positive data. However, Box and Cox did propose a second formula that can be used for negative y-values, not implemented in scipy:\n<a href=\"http://vitarts3.hospedagemdesites.ws/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/boxcoxNeg.png\"><img src=\"http://vitarts3.hospedagemdesites.ws/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/boxcoxNeg.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"272\" height=\"76\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13941\" /></a>\nThe formula are deceptively simple.

Use linear and non-linear predictors. Select the best approach with model selection.\n\nFeature selection methods can be used to identify and remove unneeded, irrelevant and redundant attributes from data that do not contribute to the accuracy of a predictive model or may in fact decrease the accuracy of the model.\n\nAll of the features we find in the dataset might not be useful in building a machine learning model to make the necessary prediction. Using some of the features might even make the predictions worse. \n![selectFeat](http://vitarts3.hospedagemdesites.ws/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Select_features.png)\nOften in data science we have hundreds or even millions of features and we want a way to create a model that only includes the most important features. This has three benefits.\n\n1. It reduces the variance of the model, and therefore overfitting.\n2. It reduces the complexity of a model and makes it easier to interpret.\n3. It improves the accuracy of a model if the right subset is chosen.\n4.Finally, it reduces the computational cost (and time) of training a model.\nSo, an alternative way to reduce the complexity of the model and avoid overfitting is dimensionality reduction via feature selection, which is especially useful for unregularized models. There are two main categories of dimensionality reduction techniques: feature selection and feature extraction. Using feature selection, we select a subset of the original features. In feature extraction, we derive information from the feature set to construct a new feature subspace.\n![image](http://www.bigdata-madesimple.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bigdata-knows-everything.jpg)\nExist various methodologies and techniques that you can use to subset your feature space and help your models perform better and efficiently.

We repeat this until no improvement is observed on removal of features.\n\nWe will see below row implementation of backward elimination, one to select by P-values and other based on the accuracy of a model the we submitted to it.\n\n##### Backward Elimination By P-values\n\nThe **P-value**, or probability value, or asymptotic significance, is a **probability** value for a given **statistical model** that, ***if the null hypothesis is true***, a set of statistical observations more commonly known as **the statistical summary** <i>is greater than or equal in magnitude to</i> **the observed results**.\n\nThe **null hypothesis** is a general statement that **there is no relationship between two measured phenomena**.\n\nFor example, if the correlation is very small and furthermore, the p-value is high meaning that it is very likely to observe such correlation on a dataset of this size purely by chance.\n\nBut you need to be careful how you interpret the statistical significance of a correlation. If your correlation coefficient has been determined to be statistically significant this does not mean that you have a strong association. It simply tests the null hypothesis that there is no relationship. By rejecting the null hypothesis, you accept the alternative hypothesis that states that there is a relationship, but with no information about the strength of the relationship or its importance.\n\nSince removal of different features from the dataset will have different effects on the p-value for the dataset, we can remove different features and measure the p-value in each case.

The motivation behind feature selection algorithms is to automatically select a subset of features that are most relevant to the problem to improve computational efficiency or reduce the generalization error of the model by removing irrelevant features or noise, ***which can be useful for algorithms that don't support regularization***.\n\nGreedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each stage of a combinatorial search problem and generally yield a suboptimal solution to the problem in contrast to exhaustive search algorithms, which evaluate all possible combinations and are guaranteed to find the optimal solution. However, in practice, an exhaustive search is often computationally not feasible, whereas greedy algorithms allow for a less complex, computationally more efficient solution.\n\nAs you saw in the previous topic, RFE is computationally less complex using the feature weight coefficients (e.g., linear models) or feature importance (tree-based algorithms) to eliminate features recursively, whereas SFSs eliminate (or add) features based on a user-defined classifier/regression performance metric.\n\nThe SBS aims to reduce the dimensionality of the initial feature subspace with a minimum decay in performance of the regressor or classifier to improve upon computational efficiency. In certain cases, SBS can even improve the predictive power of the model if a model suffers from overfitting.\n\nSBS sequentially removes features from the full feature subset until the new feature subspace contains the desired number of features. In order to determine which feature is to be removed at each stage, we need to define criterion function J that we want to minimize. The criterion calculated by the criterion function can simply be the difference in performance of the classifier after and before the removal of a particular feature. Then the feature to be removed at each stage can simply be defined as the feature that maximizes this criterion.\n\nSo, let's see a example of SBS in our data, "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"c76385c99e58fd732ed22368cb64032e4e8a1247"},"cell_type":"code","source":"from itertools import combinations\nclass SBS():\n    def __init__(self, estimator, k_features, scoring=r2_score, test_size=0.25, random_state=101):\n        self.scoring = scoring\n        self.estimator = clone(estimator)\n        self.k_features = k_features\n        self.test_size = test_size\n        self.random_state = random_state\n\n    def fit(self, X, y):\n        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=self.test_size, random_state=self.random_state)\n        dim = X_train.shape[1]\n        self.indices_ = list(range(dim))\n        self.subsets_ = [self.indices_]\n        score = self._calc_score(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, self.indices_)\n        self.scores_ = [score]\n        \n        while dim > self.k_features:\n            scores = []\n            subsets = []\n            for p in combinations(self.indices_, r=dim-1):\n                score = self._calc_score(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, list(p))\n                scores.append(score)\n                subsets.append(list(p))\n                \n            best = np.argmax(scores)\n            self.indices_ = subsets[best]\n            self.subsets_.append(self.indices_)\n            dim -= 1\n            self.scores_.append(scores[best])\n            \n        self.k_score_ = self.scores_[-1]\n        return self\n\n    def transform(self, X):\n        return X.iloc[:, self.indices_]\n    \n    def _calc_score(self, X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, indices):\n        self.estimator.fit(X_train.iloc[:, indices], y_train)\n        y_pred = self.estimator.predict(X_test.iloc[:, indices])\n        score = self.scoring(y_test, y_pred)\n        return score\n\nscore = r2_score\nls = Lasso(alpha = 0.0005, max_iter = 161, selection = 'cyclic', tol = 0.002, random_state = 101)\nsbs = SBS(ls, k_features=1, scoring= score)\nsbs.fit(df, y_train)\n\nk_feat = [len(k) for k in sbs.subsets_]\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))\nplt.plot(k_feat, sbs.scores_, marker='o')\nplt.xlim([1, len(sbs.subsets_)])\nplt.xticks(np.arange(1, len(sbs.subsets_)+1))\nplt.ylabel('R2 Score')\nplt.xlabel('Number of features')\nplt.grid(b=1)\nplt.show()\n\nprint('Best Score: {:2.2%}\\n'.format(max(sbs.scores_)))\nprint('Best score with:{0:2d}.\\n'.\\\n      format(len(list(df.columns[sbs.subsets_[np.argmax(sbs.scores_)]]))))\nSBS = list(df.columns[list(sbs.subsets_[max(np.arange(0, len(sbs.scores_))[(sbs.scores_==max(sbs.scores_))])])])\nprint('\\nBest score with {0:2d} features:\\n{1:}'.format(len(SBS), SBS))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"39e4f398388daec86a43f15e18ea9d12147e0be4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As you saw, the SBS is straightforward code to understand, but is computationally expensive.

These methods are also known as **univariate feature selection**, they examines each feature individually to determine the strength of the relationship of the feature with the dependent variable. These methods are **simple to run and understand** and are in general particularly **good for gaining a better understanding** of data, but **not necessarily for optimizing the feature set for better generalization**.\n\n![image](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/boyfriend.png)\n\nSo, the features are selected on the basis of their scores in various statistical tests for their correlation with the outcome variable. The correlation is a subjective term here. For basic guidance, you can refer to the following table for defining correlation co-efficients.\n\n| Feature/Response |       Continuous      | Categorical\n|------------------|-----------------------|------------\n| Continuous       | Pearson's Correlation | LDA\n| Categorical      | Anova                 | Chi-Square\n\nOne thing that should be kept in mind is that filter methods do not remove multicollinearity. So, you must deal with multicollinearity of features as well before training models for your data.\n\nThere are lot of different options for univariate selection.

The MI between two random variables is a non-negative value, which measures the dependency between the variables. It is equal to zero if and only if two random variables are independent, and higher values mean higher dependency. The function relies on nonparametric methods based on entropy estimation from k-nearest neighbors distances.\n![image](https://blogradiusagent.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/tenor.gif?w=770)\n\nThe methods based on F-test estimate the degree of linear dependency between two random variables.

Gini/Entropy Importance or Mean Decrease in Impurity (MDI)\n2. Permutation Importance or Mean Decrease in Accuracy \n3. Permutation with Shadow Features\n4. Gradient Boosting\n\nOthers models has concerns om **multicollinearity** problem and adding additional **constraints** or **penalty** to **regularize**. When there are multiple correlated features, as is the case with very many real life datasets, the model becomes unstable, meaning that small changes in the data can cause large changes in the model, making model interpretation very difficult on the regularization terms. \n\nThis applies to regression models like LASSO and RIDGE. In classifier cases, you can use 'SGDClassifier' where you can set the loss parameter to 'log' for Logistic Regression or 'hinge' for 'SVM'. In 'SGDClassifier' you can set the penalty to either of 'l1', 'l2' or 'elasticnet' which is a combination of both.\n\nLet's start with more details and examples:"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2226b0086f64001842b64f1693c3596bf7ae6bad"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Feature Selection by Gradient Boosting\nThe LightGBM model the importance is calculated from, if 'split', result contains numbers of times the feature is used in a model, if 'gain', result contains total gains of splits which use the feature.\n\nOn the [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_api.html) model the importance is calculated by:\n- 'weight': the number of times a feature is used to split the data across all trees.\n- 'gain': the average gain across all splits the feature is used in.\n- 'cover': the average coverage across all splits the feature is used in.\n- 'total_gain': the total gain across all splits the feature is used in.\n- 'total_cover': the total coverage across all splits the feature is used in.\n\nFirst measure is split-based and is very similar with the one given by for Gini Importance. But it doesn't take the number of samples into account.\n\nThe second measure is gain-based. It's basically the same as the Gini Importance implemented in R packages and in scikit-learn with Gini impurity replaced by the objective used by the gradient boosting model.\n\nThe cover, implemented exclusively in XGBoost, is counting the number of samples affected by the splits based on a feature.\n\nget_score(fmap='', importance_type='weight')\nGet feature importance of each feature. Importance type can be defined as:\n\nThe default measure of both XGBoost and LightGBM is the split-based one. I think this measure will be problematic if there are one or two feature with strong signals and a few features with weak signals. The model will exploit the strong features in the first few trees and use the rest of the features to improve on the residuals. The strong features will look not as important as they actually are. While setting lower learning rate and early stopping should alleviate the problem, also checking gain-based measure may be a good idea.\n\nNote that these measures are purely calculated using training data, so there's a chance that a split creates no improvement on the objective in the holdout set. This problem is more severe than in the random forest since gradient boosting models are more prone to over-fitting. \n\nFeature importance scores can be used for feature selection in scikit-learn.\n\nThis is done using the SelectFromModel class that takes a model and can transform a dataset into a subset with selected features.\n\nThis class can take a previous trained model, such as one trained on the entire training dataset. It can then use a threshold to decide which features to select. This threshold is used when you call the transform() method on the SelectFromModel instance to consistently select the same features on the training dataset and the test dataset."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"bacac941cded0af20e4cd0b5cd566cc9a14a9c61"},"cell_type":"code","source":"warnings.filterwarnings(action='ignore', category=DeprecationWarning)\n\n# split data into train and test sets\nX_train, X_test, y, y_test = train_test_split(df, y_train, test_size=0.30, random_state=101)\n\n# fit model on all training data\n#importance_type='gain'\nmodel =  XGBRegressor(base_score=0.5, colsample_bylevel=1, colsample_bytree=1, gamma=0, max_delta_step=0, \n                      random_state=101, min_child_weight=1, missing=None, n_jobs=4,  \n                      scale_pos_weight=1, seed=None, silent=True, subsample=1)\n\n\nmodel.fit(X_train, y)\nfig=plt.figure(figsize=(20,20))\nax = fig.add_subplot(121)\ng = plot_importance(model, height=0.5, ax=ax)\n\n# Using each unique importance as a threshold\nthresholds = np.sort(np.unique(model.feature_importances_)) \nbest = 1e36\ncolsbest = 31\nmy_model = model\nthreshold = 0\n\nfor thresh in thresholds:\n    # select features using threshold\n    selection = SelectFromModel(model, threshold=thresh, prefit=True)\n    select_X_train = selection.transform(X_train)\n    # train model\n    selection_model =  XGBRegressor(base_score=0.5, colsample_bylevel=1, colsample_bytree=1, gamma=0, max_delta_step=0, \n                                    random_state=101, min_child_weight=1, missing=None, n_jobs=4, \n                                    scale_pos_weight=1, seed=None, silent=True, subsample=1)\n    selection_model.fit(select_X_train, y)\n    # eval model\n    select_X_test = selection.transform(X_test)\n    y_pred = selection_model.predict(select_X_test)\n    predictions = [round(value) for value in y_pred]\n    r2 = r2_score(y_test, predictions)\n    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)\n    print(\"Thresh={:1.3f}, n={:d}, R2: {:2.2%} with MSE: {:.4f}\".format(thresh, select_X_train.shape[1], r2, mse))\n    if (best >= mse):\n        best = mse\n        colsbest = select_X_train.shape[1]\n        my_model = selection_model\n        threshold = thresh\n        \nax = fig.add_subplot(122)\ng = plot_importance(my_model,height=0.5, ax=ax, \n                    title='The best MSE: {:1.4f} with {:d} features'.\\\n                    format(best, colsbest))\n\nfeature_importances = [(score, feature) for score, feature in zip(model.feature_importances_, cols)]\nXGBest = pd.DataFrame(sorted(sorted(feature_importances, reverse=True)[:colsbest]), columns=['Score', 'Feature'])\ng = XGBest.plot(x='Feature', kind='barh', figsize=(20,10), fontsize=14, grid= True,\n     title='Original feature importance from selected features')\nplt.tight_layout();

The fact that MSE is almost always strictly positive (and not zero) is because of randomness or because the estimator does not account for information that could produce a more accurate estimate.\n![image.png](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e258221518869aa1c6561bb75b99476c4734108e)\nWhich is simply the average value of the SSE cost function that we minimize to fit the linear regression model.

The answer is not straightforward, since the magnitude of the residuals depends on the units of the response variable. That is, if your measurements are made in pounds, then the units of the residuals are in pounds. And, if your measurements are made in inches, then the units of the residuals are in inches. Therefore, there is no one \"rule of thumb\" that we can define to flag a residual as being exceptionally unusual.\n\n    There's a solution to this problem. We can make the residuals **unitless**by dividing them by their standard deviation. In this way we create what are called **standardized residuals**. They tell us how many standard deviations above — if positive — or below — if negative — a data point is from the estimated regression line. <p>\n    \n- ***They're clustered around the lower single digits of the y-axis (e.g., 0.5 or 1.5, not 30 or 150).***\n\n    Again, doesn't exist a unique rule for all cases. But, recall that the empirical rule tells us that, for data that are normally distributed, 95% of the measurements fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean. Therefore, any observations with a standardized residual greater than 2 or smaller than -2 might be flagged for further investigation. It is important to note that by using this \"greater than 2, smaller than -2 rule,\" approximately 5% of the measurements in a data set will be flagged even though they are perfectly fine. It is in your best interest not to treat this rule of thumb as a cut-and-dried, believe-it-to-the-bone, hard-and fast rule! So, in most cases it may be more practical to investigate further any observations with a standardized residual greater than 3 or smaller than -3. Using the empirical rule we would expect only 0.2% of observations to fall into this category.<p>\n    \n- ***If we see patterns in a residual plot, it means that our model is unable to capture some explanatory information.***\n\n    A special case is  any systematic (non-random) pattern.

[Lasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)) was originally formulated for least squares models and this simple case reveals a substantial amount about the behavior of the estimator, including its relationship to ridge regression and best subset selection and the connections between Lasso coefficient estimates and so-called soft thresholding. It also reveals that the coefficient estimates need not be unique if covariates are collinear.\n\nPrior to lasso, the most widely used method for choosing which covariates to include was stepwise selection, which only improves prediction accuracy in certain cases, such as when only a few covariates have a strong relationship with the outcome. However, in other cases, it can make prediction error worse. Also, at the time, ridge regression was the most popular technique for improving prediction accuracy. Ridge regression improves prediction error by shrinking large regression coefficients in order to reduce overfitting, but it does not perform covariate selection and therefore does not help to make the model more interpretable.\n\nLasso is able to achieve both of these goals by forcing the sum of the absolute value of the regression coefficients to be less than a fixed value, which depending on the regularization strength, certain weights can become zero, which makes the Lasso also useful as a supervised feature selection technique, by effectively choosing a simpler model that does not include those coefficients. However, a limitation of the Lasso is that it selects at most n variables if m > n.\n\nThis idea is similar to ridge regression, in which the sum of the squares of the coefficients is forced to be less than a fixed value, though in the case of ridge regression, this only shrinks the size of the coefficients, it does not set any of them to zero.\n\nThe optimization objective for Lasso is: `(1 / (2 * n_samples)) * ||y - Xw||^2_2 + alpha * ||w||_1`\n\nTechnically the Lasso model is optimizing the same objective function as the Elastic Net with `l1_ratio=1.0`,  no L2 penalty.\n\nThis characteristics turn Lasso a interesting alternative approach that can lead to sparse models.\n\nFrom sklearn its most important parameters are: \n- alpha: Constant that multiplies the L1 term. Defaults to 1.0. alpha = 0 is equivalent to an ordinary least square, solved by the LinearRegression object. For numerical reasons, using alpha = 0 with the Lasso object is not advised. Given this, you should use the LinearRegression object.\n- max_iter: The maximum number of iterations\n- selection: If set to 'random', a random coefficient is updated every iteration rather than looping over features sequentially by default. This (setting to 'random') often leads to significantly faster convergence especially when tol is higher than 1e-4.\n- tol: The tolerance for the optimization: if the updates are smaller than tol, the optimization code checks the dual gap for optimality and continues until it is smaller than tol.\n\nSo, I run many times my model, with different parameters, selection features, reduction or not and with and without log1P transformation of Sales Price. Below I preserve the code with the best options and with few possibilities for you can see the grid search cv in action, but I encourage you to make changes and see for yourself.

It builds the model in a stage-wise fashion like other boosting methods do, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function.\n\nOn the [sklearn implementation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor.html), in each stage a regression tree is fit on the negative gradient of the given loss function. Its most important parameters are:\n- loss: loss function to be optimized. 'ls' refers to least squares regression. 'lad' (least absolute deviation) is a highly robust loss function solely based on order information of the input variables. 'huber' is a combination of the two. 'quantile' allows quantile regression (use alpha to specify the quantile).\n- learning_rate: learning rate shrinks the contribution of each tree by learning_rate. There is a trade-off between learning_rate and n_estimators.\n- n_estimators: The number of boosting stages to perform. Gradient boosting is fairly robust to over-fitting so a large number usually results in better performance.\n- criterion: The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are 'friedman_mse' for the mean squared error with improvement score by Friedman, 'mse' for mean squared error, and 'mae' for the mean absolute error. The default value of 'friedman_mse' is generally the best as it can provide a better approximation in some cases.\n- min_samples_split: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:\n- min_samples_leaf: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at least min_samples_leaf training samples in each of the left and right branches. This may have the effect of smoothing the model, especially in regression.\n- max_depth: maximum depth of the individual regression estimators. The maximum depth limits the number of nodes in the tree. Tune this parameter for best performance; the best value depends on the interaction of the input variables.\n- alpha: The alpha-quantile of the huber loss function and the quantile loss function. Only if loss='huber' or loss='quantile'.\n- tol: Tolerance for the early stopping.

For example, in the 'large p, small n' case (high-dimensional data with few examples, what has looked like this case), the Lasso selects at most n variables before it saturates. Also if there is a group of highly correlated variables, then the Lasso tends to select one variable from a group and ignore the others. To overcome these limitations, the elastic net adds a quadratic part to the penalty. The estimates from the elastic net method are defined by:\n![image](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a66c7bfcf201d515eb71dd0aed5c8553ce990b6e)\n- Has a L1 penalty to generate sparsity. if we set l1_ratio to 1.0, the ElasticNet regressor would be equal to Lasso regression. Currently, l1_ratio <= 0.01 is not reliable, unless you supply your own sequence of alpha.\n- alpha: Constant that multiplies the penalty terms. \n- Has a L2 penalty to overcome some of the limitations of the Lasso, such as the number of selected variables.\n- The quadratic penalty term makes the loss function strictly convex, and it therefore has a unique minimum. \n\nOn [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.ElasticNet.html), if you are interested in controlling the L1 and L2 penalty separately, keep in mind that this is equivalent to::\n\n        a * L1 + b * L2    where:  alpha = a + b and l1_ratio = a / (a + b)\n        \nIts most important parameters are:\n- alpha: Constant that multiplies the penalty terms. Defaults to 1.0. See the notes for the exact mathematical meaning of this parameter.``alpha = 0`` is equivalent to an ordinary least square, solved by the LinearRegression object. For numerical reasons, using alpha = 0 with the Lasso object is not advised. Given this, you should use the LinearRegression object.\n- l1_ratio: The ElasticNet mixing parameter, with 0 <= l1_ratio <= 1. For l1_ratio = 0 the penalty is an L2 penalty. For l1_ratio = 1 it is an L1 penalty. For 0 < l1_ratio < 1, the penalty is a combination of L1 and L2.\n- max_iter: The maximum number of iterations\n- selection: If set to 'random', a random coefficient is updated every iteration rather than looping over features sequentially by default.

Regression analysis seeks to find the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable. Certain widely used methods of regression, such as ordinary least squares, have favourable properties if their underlying assumptions are true, but can give misleading results if those assumptions are not true; thus ordinary least squares is said to be not robust to violations of its assumptions. Robust regression methods are designed to be not overly affected by violations of assumptions by the underlying data-generating process.\n\nIn particular, least squares estimates for regression models are highly sensitive to (i.e. not robust against) outliers. While there is no precise definition of an outlier, outliers are observations which do not follow the pattern of the other observations. This is not normally a problem if the outlier is simply an extreme observation drawn from the tail of a normal distribution, but if the outlier results from non-normal measurement error or some other violation of standard ordinary least squares assumptions, then it compromises the validity of the regression results if a non-robust regression technique is used.\n\nFrom the sklearn the [HuberRegressor](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.HuberRegressor.html#sklearn.linear_model.HuberRegressor) implements a robust regressor strategy. The HuberRegressor is different to Ridge because it applies a linear loss to samples that are classified as outliers. A sample is classified as an inlier if the absolute error of that sample is lesser than a certain threshold. It differs from TheilSenRegressor and RANSACRegressor because it does not ignore the effect of the outliers but gives a lesser weight to them.\n\nIts main parameters are:\n- epsilon: The parameter epsilon controls the number of samples that should be classified as outliers. The smaller the epsilon, the more robust it is to outliers.\n- max_iter: Maximum number of iterations that scipy.optimize.fmin_l_bfgs_b should run for.\n- alpha: Regularization parameter.\n- tol: The iteration will stop when `max{|proj g_i | i = 1, ..., n} <= tol` where pg_i is the i-th component of the projected gradient."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"635c9c819424df6fa63418000445b64df3a449b6"},"cell_type":"code","source":"model = Pipeline([\n        ('pca', PCA(random_state = 101)),\n        ('model', HuberRegressor())])\n\nSEL = list(set(RFEcv).union(set(colsP)))\nn_components = [len(SEL)-9] #, len(SEL)-8, len(SEL)-7, len(SEL)-1] \nwhiten = [True] #, False]\nmax_iter = [2000] \nalpha = [0.0001] #, 5e-05, 0.01, 0.00005, 0.0005, 0.5, 0.001] \nepsilon = [1.005] #, 1.05, 1.01, 1.001] \ntol = [1e-01, 1e-02] #, 2e-01, 3e-01, 4e-01, 5e-01, 6e-01] \n\nparam_grid =\\\n            dict(\n                  model__max_iter= max_iter\n                  ,pca__n_components = n_components\n                  ,pca__whiten = whiten \n                  ,model__alpha = alpha\n                  ,model__epsilon = epsilon\n                  ,model__tol = tol\n               ) \n\ngs = GridSearchCV(estimator = model, param_grid = param_grid, refit = 'neg_mean_squared_error'\n                   , scoring=list(['neg_mean_squared_error' , 'neg_mean_absolute_error', 'r2']) \n                   ,cv=5, verbose=1, n_jobs=3)\n \nHub = Pipeline([\n        ('sel', select_fetaures(select_cols=SEL)),\n        ('scl', RobustScaler()),\n        ('gs', gs)\n ])\n\nHub.fit(train, y_train)\n\nres = get_results(Hub, 'Hub', log=False)\nresilduals_plots(Hub, train, y_train, log=False)\nresults = pd.concat([results, res], axis=0)\nres.loc[:, 'Scorer' : 'MeanScoreStd']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"61b0049ca6ee766ba78f9815160fd138e3af8bbd"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This model had a good performance, but some linear pattern of escape given the most scattered points on the top right."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"42e52030546fe08a87c49580db7514e18f58e965"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Passive Aggressive Regressor\nThe passive-aggressive algorithms are a family of algorithms for large-scale learning.

The gradient of the loss is estimated each sample at a time and the model is updated along the way with a decreasing strength schedule (aka learning rate).\n\nThe regularizer is a penalty added to the loss function that shrinks model parameters towards the zero vector using either the squared euclidean norm L2 or the absolute norm L1 or a combination of both (Elastic Net). If the parameter update crosses the 0.0 value because of the regularizer, the update is truncated to 0.0 to allow for learning sparse models and achieve online feature selection.\n\nThis implementation works with data represented as dense numpy arrays of floating point values for the features.\n\nThe main [parameters](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor.html) are:\n- loss: The loss function to be used. The 'squared_loss' refers to the ordinary least squares fit. 'huber' modifies 'squared_loss' to focus less on getting outliers correct by switching from squared to linear loss past a distance of epsilon. 'epsilon_insensitive' ignores errors less than epsilon and is linear past that; this is the loss function used in SVR. 'squared_epsilon_insensitive' is the same but becomes squared loss past a tolerance of epsilon.\n- penalty: The penalty (aka regularization term) to be used. Defaults to 'l2' which is the standard regularizer for linear SVM models. 'l1' and 'elasticnet' might bring sparsity to the model (feature selection) not achievable with 'l2'.\n- alpha: Constant that multiplies the regularization term. Defaults to 0.0001 Also used to compute learning_rate when set to 'optimal'.\n- l1_ratio: The Elastic Net mixing parameter, with 0 <= l1_ratio <= 1. l1_ratio=0 corresponds to L2 penalty, l1_ratio=1 to L1. Defaults to 0.15.\n- max_iter: The maximum number of passes over the training data (aka epochs). It only impacts the behavior in the fit method, and not the partial_fit. Defaults to 1000 from 0.21 version, or if tol is not None.\n- tol: The stopping criterion. If it is not None, the iterations will stop when (loss > previous_loss - tol). Defaults to 1e-3 from 0.21 version.\n- epsilon: Epsilon in the epsilon-insensitive loss functions; only if loss is 'huber', 'epsilon_insensitive', or 'squared_epsilon_insensitive'. For 'huber', determines the threshold at which it becomes less important to get the prediction exactly right. For epsilon-insensitive, any differences between the current prediction and the correct label are ignored if they are less than this threshold.\n- eta0: The initial learning rate for the 'constant', 'invscaling' or 'adaptive' schedules. The default value is 0.0 as eta0 is not used by the default schedule 'optimal'.\n- power_t:The exponent for inverse scaling learning rate. Default 0.5.\n- learning_rate: The learning rate schedule:\n  - 'constant': eta = eta0\n  - 'optimal': eta = 1.0 / (alpha * (t + t0)) where t0 is chosen by a heuristic proposed by Leon Bottou.\n  - 'invscaling': eta = eta0 / pow(t, power_t)\n  - 'adaptive': eta = eta0, as long as the training keeps decreasing. Each time n_iter_no_change consecutive epochs fail to decrease the training loss by tol or fail to increase validation score by tol if early_stopping is True, the current learning rate is divided by 5.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"dd3f417b1f112099c9fe45183faec39943cd8a12"},"cell_type":"code","source":"model = Pipeline([\n        ('pca', PCA(random_state = 101)),\n        ('model', SGDRegressor(random_state = 101))])\n\nSEL = list(set(RFEcv).union(set(colsP)))\nn_components = [len(SEL)-9, len(SEL)-8, len(SEL)-7, len(SEL)-1] \nwhiten = [True] #, False]\nloss = ['squared_loss'] #, 'huber', 'squared_epsilon_insensitive', 'epsilon_insensitive']\npenalty = ['l2'] #, 'elasticnet', 'l1']\nl1_ratio = [0.7] #, 0.8] #[0.2, 0.5, 0.03]\nlearning_rate = ['invscaling'] #, 'constant', 'optimal']\nalpha = [0.001] #
