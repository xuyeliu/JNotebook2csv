1,"## 1. Introduction

## Don't worry there is no Game Of Thrones spoilers here, so you can keep reading safely :p

This is a kernel combining data exploration analysis and ensemble modeling for house price prediction. So if you plan to buy or sell an house soon, it is highly recommended to read it :p.

The House prices is the perfect competition to introduce to regression techniques and data tranformation. Firstly, I will display some feature analysis then ill focus on feature transformation/engineering. Last part concerns modeling and prediction of houses prices using an ensemble procedure. 

This script follows four main parts:

I have tried to remove many outliers from SalePrice, GrLivArea, LotArea threshold ... but my attempts has negatively impacted the score (Public leaderboard score)

More seriously , these barplots seems to be in agreement with regression coefficients.  LotArea, GrdLivArea, GarageArea and OverallCond seems to have an important role in the prediction.

The 6 regressors have different top features according to the relative importance. It means that their predictions are not based on the same features. Nevertheless, they share some common important features for the regression , for example LotArea, GrdLivArea, GarageArea and OverallCond.

Still no LotFrontage in the top features :'( :'(",markdown,,

XGboost regressor tend to overfit the training set. According to the decreasing cross-validation curves all these regressors could perform better with more training examples.

    - Strong Feature engineering (I'hve tested some but it seems that i had more collinearity)
    - Adding external data
    - Try KRR/SVR
    - Passive Aggressive Regression
