1,"With most kernels/notebooks, you get the following steps, presented one after another:

1. Data Exploration
2. Data Engineering
3. Data Modelling
4. Results

This doesn't reflect the actual process of how you take part Kaggle competitions; in reality parts 1 through to 3 are cycled through repeatedly, in varying orders, until we finally hit stage 4.

Therefore, this is a notebook which more closely documents the actual process I took. The aim is twofold:

1. Posterity, as I will want to revisit the exact thoughts/rationales I had behind making certain choices.
2. Pedagogical, as it may benefit others to understand how I hacked and stumbled my way through this competition.

Of course, as much as it pains me, the process will be abridged as otherwise it would be far too long (it took me about 2 weeks of effort with 5 different notebooks).

At the time of writing, the below code will get you into the top 10% of the ""House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques"" tutorial competition on Kaggle. I tried to do as much of this on my own as possible, but give credit where it's due when I've adopted ideas from other Kagglers.

I also understand that some people will want a TL;DR, so see below for a summary of the contents so you can skip to the juicy bits (probably sections 5.C and 6.A-C):",markdown,,

5,"The first step is always to read the data description if avaialble. We need to build a foundation of knowledge on which we can stand, so that we can make informed decisions further down the line. The approach I will take is relatively straightforward; look for interesting things in the data which we can test out later.",markdown,,
6,"The first thing to notice is that this dataset is that there are a fair few variables. Furthermore, there seems to be categorical features listed as numbers/ordinals (MSSubClass, MoSold), and the exact opposite issue (Quality measures). We will make a note of this and see if it improves our models later.

Interestingly, it forewarns us to the presence of missing variables, which for the most case are due to a parameter not being relevant (i.e.: a one story flat will never have a properties relating to a second story).

The next thing to do is to load in the training data and understand what we will be fitting our models to.",markdown,,

Sometimes in Kaggle, the Id can represent some sort of temporal/ordinal factor, but it does not seem to be the case here. In any case, if some sort of temporal factor was present, we'd be able to get it from MoSold/YrSold, neither of which seem to possess much correlation.

Luckily, SalePrice seems to have correlations with a fair few other features. Ones which particularly jump out are OverallQual and GrLivArea, which is not hugely surprising. We should expect to see these appearing high in feature importance measures later on.

Finally, LotArea seems to be highly correlated, but missing a lot of values (over 200). This is important to note during imputation, and means we ought to spend a bit longer on this variable.",markdown,,
15,## Skews,markdown,,
16,"Recall the form of a standard linear regression

$$
y = ax_1 + bx_2 + cx_3 + ...
$$

Clearly our dependant ($y$) needs to be proportional to the other variables. This cannot be the case if the $y$ is say skewed, but the other parameters are normally distributed. Whilst this shouldn't affect tree-based regressors, it can have a drastic impact on the performance of regression based algorithms (OLS, Lasso, Ridge, KRR, etc.).

With this in mind, let's view the skews:",markdown,,

1. Careful treatment of missing value imputation
2. Converting categoricals into numericals
3. Converting numericals into categoricals
4. Unskewing variables

Before we bulldoze in with these, it is best to get a quick baseline model with little to no data engineering so we can at least have some sort of benchmark against which we can assess the effectiveness of our engineering steps.",markdown,,

1. Lasso
2. Ridge
3. Elastic Net (combination of Lasso and Ridge)

I've tried all 3 with this data set, and Lasso is by far and away the most performant. If you were to try the other 2, you will find a huge amount of overfit on the training set, even with cross validation.

With this knowledge, let's get lazy and use the LassoCV algorithm. This is effectively the same as the standard Lasso algorithm, but it will use cross validation to figure out the best parameters each time you use the model. This saves having to perform gridsearch, and typically gives identical performance. An important thing to note with these types of algorithms is the need to scale the data so that the feature space has the same sort of magnitudes in each feature's direction.",markdown,,

The beauty of Lasso is that it will drop features thanks to the use of the L1-norm. Of course this can be misleading, in the same way that a random forest's variable importances can be misleading, as having two competing but highly correlated features will mean one will get suppressed despite being highly predictive.

Since the target is only 1 or 0, the impact of these points isn't that large as long as we have a decently sized population (which we just about do with 1500). However with regression it's a different story.

I can highly recommend reading the following [lecture notes](https://quantoid.net/files/702/lecture9.pdf); in short, we can now turn to econometrics to help us deal with the effect of outliers. I'm going to outline two approaches, both of which achieve similar results.",markdown,,

187,### A more statistical approach?,markdown,,
188,"Of course we might have juts gotten lucky by stumbling upon these two outliers. Why don't we try something more analytical, and therefore repeatable?

If you refer to the notes linked above, you can find an interesting statistical test described on slides 29 onwards. Effectively we can do Leave-One-Out with a OLS, and then perform hypothesis tests on the standard deviation of the residuals (they are t-distributed), allowing us to determine which points have a significant effect on the fit of our models. To me this makes sense since the model used is OLS, and the Lasso belongs to this family of regressors.

The Bonferroni corrected test is included in Statsmodels, so we'll use it here. Note that this takes a very long time to run, so I'll simply post the code but it is up to you to run it.",markdown,,

Removing the above points gives a very similar result (0.1216x) to the one obtained by manually determining and removing the two outliers.

198,## Overfitting columns amongst other things,markdown,,
199,"At this point I averaged the result from my XGBoost and Lasso and climbed into the top 18%. I also tried a whole litany of different data engineering steps to improve my predictions to no avail.

I therefore thought it was time I checked out some other kernels to see what they were doing right. A [post](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/discussion/36280) I made was helpfully responded to by olivier, who pointed me in the direction of removing columns and overall looking at ways to improve the way my data generalised.

As a result, I discovered the incredibly comprehensive kernel of [Human Analog](https://www.kaggle.com/humananalog/xgboost-lasso). Immediately I noticed a couple things I'd been doing wrongly, including the presence of nulls in the test set.

Therefore I decided to borrow some of the ideas, as well as one of my own, which is to use the medians derived across both the test and train set.",markdown,,

201,"What is important to note however is that of all the things I borrowed from Human Analog, the most important was removing two columns which were causing overfit, namely MSSubClass_160 and MSZoning_C (all).

As to how I'd find these in reality I'm not sure. A few ideas were discussed on the aforementioned thread between myself and olivier, but it boils down to the fact that there isn't enough data in this set, which is why these features cause overfit on CV.",markdown,,

The way around this is to validate each improved hyperparameter choice with a few different seeds to ensure that the new hyperparameter really offers better generalisation.
