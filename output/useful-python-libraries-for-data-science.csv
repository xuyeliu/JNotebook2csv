Worth trying out.

### 6.5 Data Visualization
Various types of visualizations can be obtained by clicking the Visualise Dataframe, button. 

* ### Glimpse

gives an overview of all the columns, datatypes, unique and missing values
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9REEl9AtWDZOs54Sm0z5fA.png)

* ### Columns 
Give information about individual columns giving univariate and bivariate summaries. For instance, for the 'Survived' column, we can see the distribution which is 60 to 40. We can also look at the predictor and the best predictor for the Survived column is 'Sex' of the passenger. The visualizations are interactive and can be clicked to understand the relationships between different columns.

* ### Predictor patterns:

This value is obtained when each cell shows the normalized predictors score of the feature on the x-axis for the target on the y-axis.
