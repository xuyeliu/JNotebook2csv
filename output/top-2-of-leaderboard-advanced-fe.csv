### Laurens ten Cate - MBD'18 - Machine Learning II

###### If you decide to use some of my code/ideas for your own kaggle submissions/kernel submissions I would really appreciate you giving me some credit! Thanks!

Personally I was inspired with model stacking by Serigne's great notebook.
(https://www.kaggle.com/serigne/stacked-regressions-top-4-on-leaderboard)

**kaggle score notes**
- Kaggle username: Laurenstc
- Kaggle final best score: RMSLE = 0.11383
- Kaggle final best score rank: 81

**local score notes**

Locally I managed when to obtain consistent RMSE's of below 0.10. However, this notebook does not include my best local RMSE score as this was due to a ton of overfitting.

**final delivery notes**

The experimental dataset we are going to use is the House Prices Dataset. It includes 79 explanatory variables of residential homes. For more details on the dataset and the competition see https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques.

The workbook is structured as followed:

1. Data Cleaning and Pre-processing
    - Outliers
    - Statistical transformations
2. Feature Engineering
    - Concatenation
    - NA's
    - Incorrect values
    - Factorization
    - Further Statistical transformation
    - Column removal
    - Creating features
    - Dummies
    - In-depth outlier detection
    - Overfit prevention
    - Baseline model
3. Feature Selection
    - Filter methods
        - baseline coefficients
    - Embedded methods
        - L2: Ridge Regression
        - L1: Lasso regression
            - In-depth coefficient analysis
        - Elasticnet
        - XGBoost
        - SVR
        - LightGBM
3. Ensemble methods
    - Stacked generalizations
    - Averaging
        - standard
        - weighted
4. Prediction


This notebook represents the data manipulation used for my final score on Kaggle (RMSLE = 0.11383). However, in the process of achieving this score a lot of different feature engineering tactics were employed. For the sake of brevity I left these out of the notebook though below is a quick overview of other things I tried that did not help my score. 

One thing that was used but was not included is GridsearchCV. Gridsearching helped me find ranges of Alphas and L1_ratios that I could reuse later. However, it became unfeasible to continuously gridserach for optimal parameters with each iteration of feature engineering. Thats why I decided to omit the code from the final delivery.

**feature engineering tries**
- Recoding categoricals to keep ordering information (if data was really ordinal)
- Binning date variables (yearbuilt etc)
- simplify and recode neighborhood variable based on a groupby with SalePrice
- create simplified quality variables (1-5 scale instead of 1-10)
- create 2nd and 3rd order polynomials of top10 strongest correlating variables with SalePrice
- create 2nd and 3rd order polynomials of all variables
- create interaction variables by looking at individual interaction plots
- use sklearns PolynomialPreprocessing for complete set of interaction and polynomial terms

**feature selection tries**
- F-score selection 
- Mutual information regression selection
- Backwards stepwise selection (RFECV)
- Forwards stepwise selection (LARS)

Besides feature selection and engineering a lot of time was spent on optimizing my ensemble of models. I believe some more gains can be made here specifically regarding my stacked generalization model.

In the end I believe the biggest gains in my score were achieved with a few things. OLS outlier removal, nuanced NA filling and averaging with a stacked generalization model.

I believe this is due to the fact that the dimensionality of my model is crazy high compared to the amount of data (~1500 rows vs ~320 columns).

Let's see if I can get a better performance on the test data by employing ensemble methods. To stay in the constraints of the exercise I won't employ stronger models but instead combine three models.

- LassoCV
- RidgeCV
- Elasticnet

Experimenting with averaging cost a lot of time since local RMSE and kaggle RMSLE are disconnected at this point. Basically I am optimizing the tradeoff between under and over fitting.

First I'll build a meta-regressor through a process called stacking generalizations which trains a model on a part of the training set (it gets split first into a new training set and a holdout set). Then the algorithm test these models on the holdout set and uses these predictions (called out-of-fold predictions) as input for the 'meta model'. Below is a grahpical representation of the process.",markdown,,
