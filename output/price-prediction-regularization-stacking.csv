But replacing those (more than 80%) missing values with ""no pool"" will leave us with a feature with low variance, and low variance features are uniformative for machine learning models.

In regularization we worked with 3 algorithms: Ridge (L2), Lasso (L1) an ElasticNet that is a combination of both L2 and L1 regressors.
Before moving to the next section of this work, I would like to introduce a function that does all the work we did above in details **just with one line of code.** The function does all the regression pipeline:



1.  Split the data to train/test
1.  Scale the data
1.  Gridsearch for the best hyperparameters
1.  Predict the target
1.  Evaluate the prediction


The function takes as input parameters:
- x: the features
- y: the target
- modelo: Ridge(default), Lasso, ElasticNetCV
- scaler: RobustScaler(default), MinMaxSclaer, StandardScaler


<h4>In future versions, I will include more input parameters in this function to make it more flexible such as: The personalization of the hyperparameters search. <span class=""label label-info"">WORK IN PROGRESS</span></h4>
