### **Regression Evaluation Metrics**

Here are three common evaluation metrics for regression problems:

**Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** is the mean of the absolute value of the errors:

1𝑛∑𝑖=1𝑛|𝑦𝑖−𝑦̂ 𝑖|
 
**Mean Squared Error (MSE)** is the mean of the squared errors:

1𝑛∑𝑖=1𝑛(𝑦𝑖−𝑦̂ 𝑖)2
 
 
**Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** is the square root of the mean of the squared errors:

1𝑛∑𝑖=1𝑛(𝑦𝑖−𝑦̂ 𝑖)
 
**Comparing these metrics**:

MAE is the easiest to understand, because it's the average error.
MSE is more popular than MAE, because MSE ""punishes"" larger errors, which tends to be useful in the real world.
RMSE is even more popular than MSE, because RMSE is interpretable in the ""y"" units.
All of these are loss functions, because we want to minimize them.",markdown,,

# **Gradient Boosting Regression **

Gradient Boosting trains many models in a gradual, additive and sequential manner. The major difference between AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting Algorithm is how the two algorithms identify the shortcomings of weak learners (eg. decision trees). While the AdaBoost model identifies the shortcomings by using high weight data points, gradient boosting performs the same by using gradients in the loss function (y=ax+b+e , e needs a special mention as it is the error term). The loss function is a measure indicating how good are model’s coefficients are at fitting the underlying data. A logical understanding of loss function would depend on what we are trying to optimise. We are trying to predict the sales prices by using a regression, then the loss function would be based off the error between true and predicted house prices.",markdown,,

# **Decision Tree Regression **",markdown,,
76,"
The decision tree is a simple machine learning model for getting started with regression tasks.

**Background**
A decision tree is a flow-chart-like structure, where each internal (non-leaf) node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of a test, and each leaf (or terminal) node holds a class label. The topmost node in a tree is the root node. (see here for more details).

# **Support Vector Machine Regression **",markdown,,
82,"Support Vector Machine can also be used as a regression method, maintaining all the main features that characterize the algorithm (maximal margin). The Support Vector Regression (SVR) uses the same principles as the SVM for classification, with only a few minor differences. First of all, because output is a real number it becomes very difficult to predict the information at hand, which has infinite possibilities. In the case of regression, a margin of tolerance (epsilon) is set in approximation to the SVM which would have already requested from the problem. But besides this fact, there is also a more complicated reason, the algorithm is more complicated therefore to be taken in consideration. However, the main idea is always the same: to minimize error, individualizing the hyperplane which maximizes the margin, keeping in mind that part of the error is tolerated.
