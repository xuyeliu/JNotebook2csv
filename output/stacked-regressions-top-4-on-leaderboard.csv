##Serigne

**July 2017**

**If you use parts of this notebook in your scripts/notebooks, giving  some kind of credit would be very much appreciated :)  You can for instance link back to this notebook. Thanks!**",markdown,,
1,"This competition is very important to me as  it helped me to begin my journey on Kaggle few months ago. I've read  some great notebooks here. To name a few:

1. [Comprehensive data exploration with Python][1] by **Pedro Marcelino**  : Great and very motivational data analysis

2. [A study on Regression applied to the Ames dataset][2] by **Julien Cohen-Solal**  : Thorough features engeneering and deep dive into linear regression analysis  but really easy to follow for beginners.

3. [Regularized Linear Models][3] by **Alexandru Papiu**  : Great Starter kernel on modelling and Cross-validation

I can't recommend enough every beginner to go carefully through these kernels (and of course through many others great kernels) and get their first insights in data science and kaggle competitions.

After that (and some basic pratices) you should be more confident to go through [this great script][7] by **Human Analog**  who did an impressive work on features engeneering. 

As the dataset is particularly handy, I  decided few days ago to get back in this competition and apply things I learnt so far, especially stacking models. For that purpose, we build two stacking classes  ( the simplest approach and a less simple one). 

As these classes are written for general purpose, you can easily adapt them and/or extend them for your regression problems. 
The overall approach is  hopefully concise and easy to follow.. 

The features engeneering is rather parsimonious (at least compared to some others great scripts) . It is pretty much :

- **Imputing missing values**  by proceeding sequentially through the data

- **Transforming** some numerical variables that seem really categorical

- **Label Encoding** some categorical variables that may contain information in their ordering set

-  [**Box Cox Transformation**][4] of skewed features (instead of log-transformation) : This gave me a **slightly better result** both on leaderboard and cross-validation.

- ** Getting dummy variables** for categorical features. 

Then we choose many base models (mostly sklearn based models + sklearn API of  DMLC's [XGBoost][5] and Microsoft's [LightGBM][6]), cross-validate them on the data before stacking/ensembling them. The key here is to make the (linear) models robust to outliers. This improved the result both on LB and cross-validation.

127,###Less simple Stacking : Adding a Meta-model,markdown,,
128,"In this approach, we add a meta-model on averaged base models and use the out-of-folds predictions of these base models to train our meta-model. 

The procedure, for the training part, may be described as follows:


1. Split the total training set into two disjoint sets (here **train** and .**holdout** )

2. Train several base models on the first part (**train**)

3. Test these base models on the second part (**holdout**)

4. Use the predictions from 3)  (called  out-of-folds predictions) as the inputs, and the correct responses (target variable) as the outputs  to train a higher level learner called **meta-model**.

The first three steps are done iteratively . If we take for example a 5-fold stacking , we first split the training data into 5 folds. Then we will do 5 iterations. In each iteration,  we train every base model on 4 folds and predict on the remaining fold (holdout fold). 

So, we will be sure, after 5 iterations , that the entire data is used to get out-of-folds predictions that we will then use as 
new feature to train our meta-model in the step 4.

For the prediction part , We average the predictions of  all base models on the test data  and used them as **meta-features**  on which, the final prediction is done with the meta-model.
