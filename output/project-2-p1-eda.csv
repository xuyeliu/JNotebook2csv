* `GrLivArea` and `TotalBsmtSF` seem to be linearly related with 'SalePrice'. Both relationships are positive.

The relationship seems to be stronger in the case of `OverallQual`, where the box plot shows how sales prices increase with the overall quality. The same conclusion can be reached with `TotRmsAbvGrd`, though it's not as stronger as `OverallQual`.

At first sight, there are two red colored squares that get my attention. The first one refers to the `TotalBsmtSF` and `1stFlrSF` variables, and the second one refers to the `GarageX` variables. Both cases show how significant the correlation is between these variables. Actually, this correlation is so strong that it can indicate a situation of multicollinearity. If we think about these variables, we can conclude that they give almost the same information so multicollinearity really occurs. Heatmaps are great to detect this kind of situations and in problems dominated by feature selection, like ours, they are an essential tool.

Another thing that got my attention was the 'SalePrice' correlations. We can see our well-known `GrLivArea`, `TotalBsmtSF`, and `OverallQual` saying a big 'Hi!', but we can also see many other variables that should be taken into account. That's what we will do next.",markdown,,

* `TotRmsAbvGrd` and `GrLivArea` are strongly correlated each other. We can drop `TotRmsAbvGrd` as it's not as correlated with `SalePrice` than `GrLivArea`.
* `GarageCars` and `GarageArea` are also some of the most strongly correlated variables. However, as we discussed in the last sub-point, the number of cars that fit into the garage is a consequence of the garage area. `GarageCars` and `GarageArea` are like twin brothers. You'll never be able to distinguish them. Therefore, we just need one of these variables in our analysis (we can keep 'GarageCars' since its correlation with 'SalePrice' is higher).
* `TotalBsmtSF` and `1stFloor` also seem to be twin brothers. We can keep `TotalBsmtSF` just to say that our first guess was right.
* `FullBath` seems odd but expected
* `TotRmsAbvGrd` and `GrLivArea` are also highly correlated with each other. 
* `YearBuilt`: It seems that `YearBuilt` is slightly correlated with `SalePrice`. Honestly, it scares me to think about `YearBuilt` because I start feeling that we should do a little bit of time-series analysis to get this right. I'll leave this as a homework for you.",markdown,,

79,"# Target Assumptions

**Question:** Who is `SalePrice`?


The answer to this question lies in testing for the assumptions underlying the statistical bases for multivariate analysis. We already did some data cleaning and discovered a lot about `SalePrice`. Now it's time to go deep and understand how 'SalePrice' complies with the statistical assumptions that enables us to apply multivariate techniques.
",markdown,,
80,"According to [Hair et al. (2013)](https://amzn.to/2uC3j9p), four assumptions should be tested:

* **Normality** - When we talk about normality what we mean is that the data should look like a normal distribution. This is important because several statistic tests rely on this (e.g. t-statistics). In this exercise we'll just check univariate normality for 'SalePrice' (which is a limited approach). Remember that univariate normality doesn't ensure multivariate normality (which is what we would like to have), but it helps. Another detail to take into account is that in big samples (>200 observations) normality is not such an issue. However, if we solve normality, we avoid a lot of other problems (e.g. heteroscedacity) so that's the main reason why we are doing this analysis.

* **Homoscedasticity** - I just hope I wrote it right. Homoscedasticity refers to the 'assumption that dependent variable(s) exhibit equal levels of variance across the range of predictor variable(s)' (Hair et al., 2013). Homoscedasticity is desirable because we want the error term to be the same across all values of the independent variables.

* **Linearity**- The most common way to assess linearity is to examine scatter plots and search for linear patterns. If patterns are not linear, it would be worthwhile to explore data transformations. However, we'll not get into this because most of the scatter plots we've seen appear to have linear relationships.

* **Absence of correlated errors** - Correlated errors, like the definition suggests, happen when one error is correlated to another. For instance, if one positive error makes a negative error systematically, it means that there's a relationship between these variables. This occurs often in time series, where some patterns are time related. We'll also not get into this. However, if you detect something, try to add a variable that can explain the effect you're getting. That's the most common solution for correlated errors.",markdown,,
81,"## **Normality**

The point here is to test 'SalePrice' in a very lean way. We'll do this paying attention to:

* **Histogram** - Kurtosis and skewness.
* **Normal probability plot** - Data distribution should closely follow the diagonal that represents the normal distribution.",markdown,,

127,"**Insights on all categorical features**
* After reading features decription the categorical features, my conclusions are:
1. `MSZoning`: Tells about the zone the house is located in, but we already have a neigborhood variable that'll be more effective.
2. `Street`, `Alley` and `LotConfig` don't seem that important.
3. `LandContour`,  `LotShape`, `LandSlope`: are basically giving the same information, they might be correlated with each other too.
4. `Utilities`: is an important feature as it generally affects the price of a house.
5. `Neigborhood`: Location is important while buying a house though we ended up discarding it in the initial selection as most of the SalePrice values are have overlapping with each other.
6. `Condition1` and `Condition2`: `Condition1` seems a good choice.
7. `BldgType` and `HouseStyle`: Both are important factors for pricing.
8. `RoofStyle`, `RoofMatl`: Does it matter as long is it sturdy?. 
9. `Exterior1st`, `Exterior2nd`: Both seem to have effect on the Sales Price.
10. `MasVnrType`: From above it does seem to be important (feature selection will help in determining this).
11. `ExterQual` and `ExterCond`: `ExterCond` seems a likely choice as the current condition of the externals determines the price more than what it was.
12. `Foundation`: one of the main ingredients in determing house prices.
13. `BsmtQual`, `BsmtCond`, `BsmtExposure`, `BsmtFinType1`, `BsmtFinType2`: Earlier during missing value analysis there was consistency in  the rows that matched. These features might be correlated with each other so we can either take just one of two features that represents the `BsmtX` variables and have high correlation with the `SalePrice`. `BsmtQual` and `BsmtExposure` seem optimal choices.
14. `Heating`, `HeatingQC`: `HeatingQC` seems a good choice of the two.
15. `CentralAir`, `Electrical`: Though not many of us would ask the type of electrical system in the house as an initial question but information about the conditioning might play a role in determining the price.
16. `KitchenQual`: an important factor we would all agree on.
17. `FireplaceQu`: It has a lot of missing values as if fireplace is not present, but does affect the pricing of the house if present.
18. `GarageType`, `GarageFinish`, `GarageQual`,  `GarageCond`: as dicussed earlier to represent all these features `GarageCars` might be sufficienct.
19. `PoolQC`, `Fence`: too many missing values.
20. `MiscFeature`: `MiscVal` feature might be all that's necessary.
21. `SaleType` and `SaleCondition`: Personally don't think would affect the Sale price value of the house that much.
22. `PavedDrive`: Surroundings do affect the price of a house.
