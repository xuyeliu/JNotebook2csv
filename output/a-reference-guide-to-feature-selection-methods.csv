# **A Reference Guide to Feature Selection Methods**


Hello friends,


**Feature Selection** is the process of selecting optimal number of features from a larger set of features. There are several advantages of this feature selection process and also there are various techniques available for this feature selection process. In this kernel, we will look at these advantages and various techniques for feature selection.


So, let's get started.",markdown,,
1,"This kernel is based on Soledad Galli's course - [Feature Selection for Machine Learning](https://www.udemy.com/course/feature-selection-for-machine-learning/)

She had done a fabulous job in her above course wherein she had put all the major feature selection techniques together at one place. I have adapted code and instructions from her course in this kernel. I like to congratulate her for her excellent work.",markdown,,

## **Feature selection**

- **Feature selection** or **variable selection** is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features or variables from the total features of a level in a data set to build machine learning algorithms. 


## **Advantages of selecting features**

- There are various advantages of feature selection process. These are as follows:-

  1.	Improved accuracy
  2.    Simple models are easier to interpret.
  3.	Shorter training times
  4.	Enhanced generalization by reducing Overfitting
  5.	Easier to implement by software developers
  6.	Reduced risk of data errors by model use
  7.	Variable redundancy
  8.	Bad learning behaviour in high dimensional spaces


## **Feature Selection – Techniques**


- Feature selection techniques are categorized into 3 typers. These are as follows:-

  1.    Filter methods
  2.	Wrapper methods
  3.	Embedded methods
  
  
## **Filter Methods**

[Table of Contents](#0.1)


- Filter methods are generally used as a preprocessing step. The selection of features is independent of any machine learning algorithms. Instead, features are selected on the basis of their scores in various statistical tests for their correlation with the outcome variable. The characteristics of these methods are as follows:-

  - These methods rely on the characteristics of the data (feature characteristics)
  - They do not use machine learning algorithms.
  - These are model agnostic.
  - They tend to be less computationally expensive.
  - They usually give lower prediction performance than wrapper methods.
  - They are very well suited for a quick screen and removal of irrelevant features.
  
  
 - Filter methods consists of various techniques as given below:-

[Table of Contents](#0.1)

- Constant features are those that show the same value, just one value, for all the observations of the dataset. This is, the same value for all the rows of the dataset. These features provide no information that allows a machine learning model to discriminate or predict a target.

- Identifying and removing constant features, is an easy first step towards feature selection and more easily interpretable machine learning models. To identify constant features, we can use the VarianceThreshold function from sklearn.

- I will demonstrate how to identify constant features using the Santander Customer Satisfaction dataset from Kaggle.

So we should be careful when removing these type of features. Identifying and removing quasi-constant features, is an easy first step towards feature selection and more easily interpretable machine learning models.

[Table of Contents](#0.1)


- Univariate feature selection methods works by selecting the best features based on univariate statistical tests like ANOVA. It can be seen as a preprocessing step to an estimator. Scikit-learn exposes feature selection routines as objects that implement the transform method.

- The methods based on F-test estimate the degree of linear dependency between two random variables. They assume a linear relationship between the feature and the target. These methods also assume that the variables follow a Gaussian distribution.

- There are 4 methods that fall under this category :-

  1. SelectKBest
  2. SelectPercentile
  3. SelectFpr, SelectFdr, or family wise error SelectFwe
  4. GenericUnivariateSelection

- This method select features according to the k highest scores.

- For instance, we can perform a chi-square test to the samples to retrieve only the two best features from iris dataset as follows:

[Table of Contents](#0.1)


- **Information gain** or **mutual information** measures how much information the presence/absence of a feature contributes to making the correct prediction on the target.


- In terms of  [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information):


   - **Mutual information measures the information that X and Y share: It measures how much knowing one of these        variables reduces uncertainty about the other. For example, if X and Y are independent, then knowing X does        not give any information about Y and vice versa, so their mutual information is zero. At the other extreme, if      X is a deterministic function of Y and Y is a deterministic function of X then all information conveyed by X        is shared with Y: knowing X determines the value of Y and vice versa. As a result, in this case the mutual          information is the same as the uncertainty contained in Y (or X) alone, namely the entropy of Y (or X).            Moreover, this mutual information is the same as the entropy of X and as the entropy of Y. (A very special          case of this is when X and Y are the same random variable.)**
",markdown,,
53,"## **mutual_info_classif**


- It estimates mutual information for a discrete target variable.

- Mutual information (MI) between two random variables is a non-negative value, which measures the dependency between the variables. It is equal to zero if and only if two random variables are independent, and higher values mean higher dependency. 

- This function relies on nonparametric methods based on entropy estimation from k-nearest neighbors distances.

- It can be used for univariate features selection.

- **Correlation** is a measure of the linear relationship of 2 or more variables. Through correlation, we can predict one variable from the other.

- **Good variables are highly correlated with the target**.

- Correlated predictor variables provide redundant information.

- **Variables should be correlated with the target but uncorrelated among themselves**.


- Correlation Feature Selection evaluates subsets of features on the basis of the following hypothesis: 

   - ""Good feature subsets contain features highly correlated with the target, yet uncorrelated to each other"".
   
   
- In this section,  I will demonstrate how to select features based on correlation between two features. We can find features that are correlated with each other. By identifying these features, we can then decide which features we want to keep, and which ones we want to remove.
",markdown,,
68,"- Using Pearson correlation our returned coefficient values will vary between -1 and 1.

- If the correlation between two features is 0 this means that changing any of these two features will not affect the other.

- If the correlation between two features is greater than 0 this means that increasing the values in one feature will make increase also the values in the other feature (the closer the correlation coefficient is to 1 and the stronger is going to be this bond between the two different features).

- If the correlation between two features is less than 0 this means that increasing the values in one feature will make decrease the values in the other feature (the closer the correlation coefficient is to -1 and the stronger is going to be this relationship between the two different features).

- In wrapper methods, we try to use a subset of features and train a model using them. Based on the inferences that we draw from the previous model, we decide to add or remove features from the subset. The problem is essentially reduced to a search problem. These methods are usually computationally very expensive.

- Some common examples of wrapper methods are 

  - 1. Forward selection, 
  - 2. Backward elimination, 
  - 3. Exhaustive feature selection,
  - 4. Recursive feature elimination.
  - 5. Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation

[Table of Contents](#0.1) 


- Forward selection is an iterative method in which we start with having no feature in the model. In each iteration, we keep adding the feature which best improves our model till an addition of a new variable does not improve the performance of the model.

- The procedure starts with an empty set of features [reduced set]. The best of the original features is determined and added to the reduced set. At each subsequent iteration, the best of the remaining original attributes is added to the set.

- Step forward feature selection starts by evaluating all features individually and selects the one that generates the best performing algorithm, according to a pre-set evaluation criteria. In the second step, it evaluates all possible combinations of the selected feature and a second feature, and selects the pair that produce the best performing algorithm based on the same pre-set criteria.

- The pre-set criteria can be the roc_auc for classification and the r squared for regression for example.

- This selection procedure is called greedy, because it evaluates all possible single, double, triple and so on feature combinations. Therefore, it is quite computationally expensive, and sometimes, if feature space is big, even unfeasible.

- There is a special package for python that implements this type of feature selection: mlxtend.

- In the mlxtend implementation of the step forward feature selection, the stopping criteria is an arbitrarily set number of features. So the search will finish when we reach the desired number of selected features.

- I will demonstrate the Step Forward feature selection algorithm from mlxtend using the House Price dataset.

[Table of Contents](#0.1) 


- In an exhaustive feature selection the best subset of features is selected, over all possible feature subsets, by optimizing a specified performance metric for a certain machine learning algorithm. For example, if the classifier is a logistic regression and the dataset consists of 4 features, the algorithm will evaluate all 15 feature combinations as follows:

  - all possible combinations of 1 feature
  - all possible combinations of 2 features
  - all possible combinations of 3 features
  - all the 4 features
  
  
and select the one that results in the best performance (e.g., classification accuracy) of the logistic regression classifier.

- This is another greedy algorithm as it evaluates all possible feature combinations. It is quite computationally expensive, and sometimes, if feature space is big, even unfeasible.

- There is a special package for python that implements this type of feature selection: mlxtend.

- In the mlxtend implementation of the exhaustive feature selection, the stopping criteria is an arbitrarily set number of features. So the search will finish when we reach the desired number of selected features.

- This is somewhat arbitrary because we may be selecting a subopimal number of features, or likewise, a high number of features.",markdown,,

- It is a greedy optimization algorithm which aims to find the best performing feature subset. It repeatedly creates models and keeps aside the best or the worst performing feature at each iteration. It constructs the next model with the left features until all the features are exhausted. It then ranks the features based on the order of their elimination.

- Recursive feature elimination performs a greedy search to find the best performing feature subset. It iteratively creates models and determines the best or the worst performing feature at each iteration. It constructs the subsequent models with the left features until all the features are explored. It then ranks the features based on the order of their elimination. In the worst case, if a dataset contains N number of features RFE will do a greedy search for 2N combinations of features.

[Table of Contents](#0.1)


- Embedded methods are iterative in a sense that takes care of each iteration of the model training process and carefully extract those features which contribute the most to the training for a particular iteration. Regularization methods are the most commonly used embedded methods which penalize a feature given a coefficient threshold.

- This is why Regularization methods are also called penalization methods that introduce additional constraints into the optimization of a predictive algorithm (such as a regression algorithm) that bias the model toward lower complexity (fewer coefficients).

- Some of the most popular examples of these methods are LASSO and RIDGE regression which have inbuilt penalization functions to reduce overfitting.

- Embedded methods can be explained with the help of following graphic:

[Table of Contents](#0.1)


- Lasso regression performs L1 regularization which adds penalty equivalent to absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients.

- Regularisation consists in adding a penalty to the different parameters of the machine learning model to reduce the freedom of the model and in other words to avoid overfitting. In linear model regularisation, the penalty is applied over the coefficients that multiply each of the predictors. From the different types of regularisation, Lasso or l1 has the property that is able to shrink some of the coefficients to zero. Therefore, that feature can be removed from the model.

111,"## **4.2 ** Random Forest Importance<a class=""anchor"" id=""4.2""></a>

[Table of Contents](#0.1)

- Random forests are one the most popular machine learning algorithms. They are so successful because they provide in general a good predictive performance, low overfitting and easy interpretability. This interpretability is given by the fact that it is straightforward to derive the importance of each variable on the tree decision. In other words, it is easy to compute how much each variable is contributing to the decision.

- Random forests consist of 4-12 hundred decision trees, each of them built over a random extraction of the observations from the dataset and a random extraction of the features. Not every tree sees all the features or all the observations, and this guarantees that the trees are de-correlated and therefore less prone to over-fitting. Each tree is also a sequence of yes-no questions based on a single or combination of features. At each node (this is at each question), the three divides the dataset into 2 buckets, each of them hosting observations that are more similar among themselves and different from the ones in the other bucket. Therefore, the importance of each feature is derived by how ""pure"" each of the buckets is.

- For classification, the measure of impurity is either the Gini impurity or the information gain/entropy. For regression the measure of impurity is variance. Therefore, when training a tree, it is possible to compute how much each feature decreases the impurity. The more a feature decreases the impurity, the more important the feature is. In random forests, the impurity decrease from each feature can be averaged across trees to determine the final importance of the variable.

- To give a better intuition, features that are selected at the top of the trees are in general more important than features that are selected at the end nodes of the trees, as generally the top splits lead to bigger information gains.

- Please see my kernel, [Random Forest Classifier + Feature Importance - Section 13. Find important features with Random Forest model](https://www.kaggle.com/prashant111/random-forest-classifier-feature-importance) to know how to find important features using the random forest model.

## **Image Source : Machine Learning Mastery**",markdown,,
126,"## **Numerical Input, Numerical Output**

- This is a regression predictive modeling problem with numerical input variables.

- The most common techniques are to use a correlation coefficient, such as Pearson’s for a linear correlation, or rank-based methods for a nonlinear correlation.

- The tests emplyed are as follows:-

  - Pearson’s correlation coefficient (linear).
  - Spearman’s rank coefficient (nonlinear)
  
  
## **Numerical Input, Categorical Output**

- This is a classification predictive modeling problem with numerical input variables.

- This might be the most common example of a classification problem,

- Again, the most common techniques are correlation based, although in this case, they must take the categorical target into account.

- We can employ the following tests as follows:-

  - ANOVA correlation coefficient (linear).
  - Kendall’s rank coefficient (nonlinear).
  
- Kendall does assume that the categorical variable is ordinal.


## **Categorical Input, Numerical Output**

- This is a regression predictive modeling problem with categorical input variables.

- This is a strange example of a regression problem (e.g. we will not encounter it often).

- We can use the same “Numerical Input, Categorical Output” methods (described above), but in reverse.




## **Categorical Input, Categorical Output**

- This is a classification predictive modeling problem with categorical input variables.

- The most common correlation measure for categorical data is the chi-squared test. We can also use mutual information (information gain) from the field of information theory.

- The following tests can be employed in this case -

  - Chi-Squared test (contingency tables).
  - Mutual Information.
  
In fact, mutual information is a powerful method that may prove useful for both categorical and numerical data, e.g. it is agnostic to the data types.",markdown,,
127,"# **6. Tips and Tricks for Feature Selection** <a class=""anchor"" id=""6""></a>

[Table of Contents](#0.1)


- In this section, we provide some additional considerations when using filter-based feature selection.


## **Correlation Statistics**

- The scikit-learn library provides an implementation of most of the useful statistical measures.

- For example:

   - Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient: [f_regression()](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.f_regression.html)
   - ANOVA: [f_classif()](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.f_classif.html)
   - Chi-Squared: [chi2()](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.chi2.html)
   - Mutual Information: [mutual_info_classif()](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.mutual_info_classif.html) and [mutual_info_regression()](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.mutual_info_regression.html).
   
   
- Also, the SciPy library provides an implementation of many more statistics, such as Kendall’s tau (kendalltau) and Spearman’s rank correlation (spearmanr).


## **Selection Method**

- The scikit-learn library also provides many different filtering methods once statistics have been calculated for each input variable with the target.

- Two of the more popular methods include:

    - Select the top k variables: [SelectKBest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SelectKBest.html)
    - Select the top percentile variables: [SelectPercentile](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SelectPercentile.html)
    


## **Transform Variables**

- We can consider transforming the variables in order to access different statistical methods. For example, we can transform a categorical variable to ordinal, even if it is not, and see if any interesting results come out.

- We can also make a numerical variable discrete (e.g. bins); try categorical-based measures.

- Some statistical measures assume properties of the variables, such as Pearson’s that assumes a Gaussian probability distribution to the observations and a linear relationship. You can transform the data to meet the expectations of the test and try the test regardless of the expectations and compare results.


## **What Is the Best Method?**

- There is no best feature selection method. Just like there is no best set of input variables or best machine learning algorithm. 

- Instead, we must discover what works best for your specific problem using careful systematic experimentation.

- We should try a range of different models fit on different subsets of features chosen via different statistical measures and discover what works best for your specific problem.


## **4 best ways of Feature Selection**

- The 4 practical ways of feature selection which yield best results are as follows:-

    1. SelectKBest
    2. Recursive Feature Elimination
    3. Correlation-matrix with heatmap
