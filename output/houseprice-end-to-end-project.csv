0,"This notebook aims to show how we could approach this competition in a realistic setting. This means in a setting where we genuinely do not have the test set and we have to deliver a model that performs reasonably well. Moreover, we want to be able to explain where our model shines and where it is not as trustworthy.

The key concepts for a realistic end-to-end project that we will explore are:

* efficient validation strategy, because we will rely solely on this to chose and perfect our final model
* use of pipelines, because we want to simply apply our final result to unseen data (the test set)
* feature engineering and feature selection, because we want to do both quickly and efficiently
* utility scripts are your friends, because nobody likes having so much code in the notebook.

The steps we will follow are:

**Note: this notebook is still a work in progress, in bold the sections that are already there**

* **data cleaning**
* **data exploration**
* **first models**
* **feature engineering**
* **hyperparameter tuning**
* **error analysis**
* stacking
* model explainability
* final submission

*Note: from version 23, I needed a newer version of scikit-learn, please indulge me in the occasional execution error and remember to turn the internet on if you fork this notebook*",markdown,,

If we were doing the data exploration phase before this step, we would have used information coming from both sets to take decisions, a luxury that in a realistic situation we won't have.

How to split the data? Giving the size of the training set, it makes sense to use a 80-20 split. A random split will do the job just fine but we can also use some knowledge of the problem.

24,"# Get insights from the data

This phase is tricky because it is easy to go too deep into the rabbit hole. We want to have a comprehensive understanding of the data but at the same time we don't want to spend too much time on it. While in this dataset the number of features is fairly limited, in other cases a slow approach can cost us weeks of work and, at this stage, we don't know if this work is worth weeks of our time.

We will thus focus on the following:

* Correlation with the target
* Univariate and bivariate analysis of the interesting features
* Interesting segmentations with categorical features

Once again, please note how we don't use the full training set but only what we have created in the previous section.

To first identify what can be interesting, we can look the correlations with the target. This is not by any means enough or necessary to make a feature interesting but, in absence of other knowledge, it is a good first step.",markdown,,

35,"Yes, it is very clear indeed. Let's move on to the categorical features.

## Categorical features

In this dataset we don't have many features and, thanks to the function in the `explore_data` utility script, we can quickly shuffle through all of them to find the interesting one. If this was not possible, one approach would be to find the features whose cateogories exhibit a significantly different distribution of the target variable. In other words, for example, if the distribution of prices for houses withouth a Fence is significantly different than the ones with a Fence, the next function will catch it and tell us.",markdown,,

The same holds for `KitchenQual`",markdown,,

45,"exp.segm_target(train_cleaned, 'MasVnrType', 'target')",code,,

47,"exp.segm_target(train_cleaned, 'CentralAir', 'target')",code,,
48,"exp.segm_target(train_cleaned, 'GarageFinish', 'target')",code,,
49,Another way of looking at these features is to combine them in a plot together with another numerical feature. We know that `GrLivArea` is going to be important and our function told us that `HouseStyle` has interesting categories in it. We can combine them like this,markdown,,
50,"exp.plot_bivariate(train_cleaned, 'GrLivArea', 'target', hue='HouseStyle', alpha=0.7)",code,,
51,Or use this plot to just investigate further the features we have analyzed before,markdown,,

53,"As mentioned before, it is easy to go too deep in the rabbit hole in this phase. I have been writing this section for an hour already and I feel confident enough about the data to run the first models.

# First models, validation, and error analysis.

This section has multiple goals, the main one is to bridge to the next section about feature engineering. We want to implement a system of evaluating, selecting, and tuning our models that is robust enough to the data processing phase. If we do this part correctly, we will be able to quickly iterate between the processing and modeling phase, being confident that we can correctly assess the validity of our actions.

84,"The choice was driven by a combination of factors, for example:

* the feature has mainly one value
* the feature does not display any particular pattern (and we want to keep the model simple)
* The feature should not play a role in determining the cost (this comes with the knowledge and biases of the author)

Then there is a number of feature we want to create and we are not particularly sure if they will be helpful or not. For example, we have seen that some features can be safely converted into ordinal ones but others do not display an equally clear pattern and might be more useful as dummies. As another example, we created a new feature for the total number of baths and it looks promising but we are not sure if it is worth dropping all the other original features in its favor. 

We can stay here all day trying to think about the right combination of transformations we need for the optimal set of features but we are getting better in the use of pipelines, it is time to exploit that.

We can design our transformers in order to have parameters that determine whether or not a feature should be transformed/created. In this way, we can tune those parameters with GridSearch or RandomSearch and obtain the best set for every model.

# Hyperparameter tuning

The key, and for some the novelty, of this phase is to tune both the parameters of the chosen algorithm (like the regularization in `Lasso`) and the one controlling on the creation of new features or on how to scale the data at the same time.

It is important, as before, to not fall too deep into the rabbit hole we need to be pragmatic. Most of the parameters we want to tune will have such a small influence on the model and such a high cost in terms of computation time that we have to be able to explore the sections of the parameter space that really matter.

To achieve that, it is a good practice to quickly iterate on different configurations and keep track of the effects of our choices. Even if this means coming back to the previous section and create something new. Depending on when you read this notebook, you will see different iterations of this phase (or probably the final iteration). I will try to explain as good as I can why some things were done and some other weren't.

As of now, the full pipeline (without the model) looks like this.",markdown,,

In terms of mean absolute error, we go from a little bit more than 15000 dollars to a bit less than 15000. In a real project, it is a good idea to keep track of the time and effort we put in fine tuning our model and evaluate if the project gets a significant benefit from this time and effort.

In this case, the tuning took us not more than 2 hours and a model that is about 1000 dollars more accurate is worth 2 hours of work.

To be fair, we should not compare the results obtained on the training set. Even though we are using our pipeline and k-fold cross-validation, some information is leaking from the training folds to the test folds in the form of our decisions iteration after iteration. In other words, each iteration we tweak the model to get a better score and this is a good strategy to tune it. However, we are, in a sense, *overfitting the test* folds.

Therefore a proper indication of what our model is doing can only come from the test set. It is very important that we use this set only to monitor the performance and not to take further modeling decisions or we risk of overfitting that set too.

## Interpreting the results

We may have to explain to the stakeholders of the project what is our model doing to make its prediction. This is a very complicated question when we step away from the simplest models (that, to be honest, are performing well enough if we compare them to the more complex ones here presented). However, some simple things might just do the job.
