__Introduction__:

Develop your skills in data science through a useful and common case to everyone, the forecast of the sale prices of houses. With this premise there is a plethora of available data, where we can highlight the data set of [Boston Housing](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston) from Harrison and Rubinfeld (1978) as the most famous for beginners and already much explored.

But after so many years would this data set present enough complexity and challenge for students to practice a whole range of new knowledge acquired in their courses in statistics and data science? Would it have a sufficient number of observations and features to make it necessary to analyze outliers, collinearity, multicollinearity, the need for selection and reduction of dimensionality of features, it to not mention its applicability to more modern machine learning techniques and algorithms?

Not in the opinion of [Dr Dean De Cock](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dean-de-cock-b5336537/), Professor of Statistics at Truman State University. He was looking for a data set that would allow students the opportunity to display the skills they had learned within the class.

In his quest, he finally found with the Ames City Assessor's Office a potential data set. The initial Excel file contained 113 variables describing 3970 property sales that had occurred in Ames, Iowa between 2006 and 2010. The variables were a mix of nominal, ordinal, continuous, and discrete variables used in calculation of assessed values and included physical property measurements in addition to computation variables used in the city's assessment process. For Dr Dean purposes, a ""layman's"" data set that could be easily understood by users at all levels was desirable; so He began his project by removing any variables that required special knowledge or previous calculations for their use. Most of these deleted variables were related to weighting and adjustment factors used in the city's current modeling system. 

In the end, the selected dataset has 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The case was so interesting that it was introduced as one of the competitions for beginners of Kaggle, quickly becoming one of the most popular. If you interest to get some insights and suggestions directly from Dr Dean before start, I recommend that you read his [paper](http://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock.pdf).

With this spirit, I create this material, not with the purpose of competing, but of intended to cover most of the techniques of data analysis in Python for regression analysis. That is why it follows the natural flow of ML and contains many texts and links to the techniques, made your conference and references easy. as it can be extended over time.

In order not to fall into monotony, sometimes I take some liberties and apply a little humor, but nothing that compromises the accuracy of knowledge that is being acquired by the reader. Of course, anyone who wants to contribute some addition or even a claim or choreography will be very welcome. But what should you be thinking now? So, enough of tangle and let's go.

It rates the overall material and finish of the house on a scale from 1 (very poor) to 10 (very excellent). The positive correlation is certainly there indeed, and seems to be a slightly upward curve. Regarding outliers, I do not see any extreme values. If there is a candidate to take out as an outlier later on, it seems to be the expensive house with grade 4.

Especially the two houses with really big living areas and low SalePrices seem outliers. I will not take them out yet, as taking outliers can be dangerous. For instance, a low score on the Overall Quality could explain a low price. However, as you can see below, these two houses actually also score maximum points on Overall Quality. Therefore, I will keep theses houses in mind as prime candidates to take out as outliers.

From the **Probability Plot**, we could see that **Sales Price** also does **not align with the diagonal  <span style=""color:red"">red line</span>** which represent normal distribution. The form of its distribution confirm that is a skewed right. 

With ***skewness positive of 1.9***, we confirm the **lack of symmetry** and indicate that Sales Price are **skewed right**, as we can see too at the Sales Distribution plot, skewed right means that the right tail is **long relative to the left tail**. The skewness for a normal distribution is zero, and any symmetric data should have a skewness near zero. A distribution, or data set, is symmetric if it looks the same to the left and right of the center point.

**Kurtosis** is a measure of whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution. That is, data sets with high kurtosis tend to have heavy tails, or outliers, and **positive** kurtosis indicates a **heavy-tailed distribution** and **negative** kurtosis indicates a **light tailed distribution**. So, with 6.5 of positive kurtosis **Sales Price** are definitely heavy-tailed and has some **outliers** that we need take care.

Note that in contrast to common belief, training a linear regression model does not require that the explanatory or target variables are normally distributed. The normality assumption is only a requirement for certain statistical tests and hypothesis tests.

- we can safely eliminate the living area, and as there are no records with it zero or null we will not create an existence indicator for it.
- We may be able to discard other area metrics, especially those that have many zeros for nulls, which contribute little to accuracy and even to reduce multicollinearity.
- the **polynomial transformation of 3<sup>th</sup> degree** presents ***improvements*** of **2.6%** and **1.8%** of  RMSE and R<sup>2</sup> respectively. So, now we have a simple regressor from our specialist to bit!

124,"### One Hot Encode Categorical Features
You might now be wondering, if we have a data set wheres all categorical data already transformed and mapped them into numeric representations, why would we need more levels of encoding again? 
![image](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/ee/bd/70/eebd70b6a2a1bc9d403bb92af62ef8bd--symbol-logo-open-data.jpg)
To traditional people and liberals, I am not discussing a question of gender or option, but rather that If we directly fed these transformed numeric representations of categorical features into any algorithm, the model will essentially try to interpret these as raw numeric features and hence the notion of magnitude will be wrongly introduced in the system.

There are several schemes and strategies where dummy features are created for each unique value or label out of all the distinct categories in any feature, like one hot encoding, dummy coding, effect coding, and feature hashing schemes.

In one hot encoding strategy we considering have numeric representation of any categorical feature with m labels, the one hot encoding scheme, encodes or transforms the feature into m binary features, which can only contain a value of 1 or 0. Each observation in the categorical feature is thus converted into a vector of size m with only one of the values as 1 (indicating it as active). 

From sklearn in preprocessing you can use the  LabelEncoder to create a cod map for the category feature than use the OneHotEncoder to apply the one hot encode strategy above then. This is interesting for most real cases where your model will be applied to data that will be fed and updated continuously in a pipeline.

As our case is restricted to the data provided and it fits on a pandas data frame, we will make use of the function get_dummies from pandas, but attention this function does not transform the data to a vector as in the case of the previous or as in R.

The dummy coding scheme is similar to the one hot encoding scheme, except in the case of dummy coding scheme, when applied on a categorical feature with m distinct labels, we get m-1 binary features. Thus each value of the categorical variable gets converted into a vector of size m-1. The extra feature is completely disregarded and thus if the category values range from {0, 1, ..., m-1} the 0th or the m-1th feature is usually represented by a vector of all zeros (0).",markdown,,

To quantify the linear relationship between the features, I will now create a correlation matrix. 
 
The correlation matrix is identical to a covariance matrix computed from standardized data. The correlation matrix is a square matrix that contains the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients (often abbreviated as [Pearson's r](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient)), which measure the linear dependence between pairs of features:
![image](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/602e9087d7a3c4de443b86c734d7434ae12890bc)
Pearson's correlation coefficient can simply be calculated as the covariance between two features x and y (numerator) divided by the product of their standard deviations (denominator):
![image](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/f76ccfa7c2ed7f5b085115086107bbe25d329cec)
The covariance between standardized features is in fact equal to their linear correlation coefficient.
Use NumPy's corrcoef and seaborn's heatmap functions to plot the correlation matrix array as a heat map.

From the graph above, it also becomes clear the multicollinearity is an issue. 
 - The correlation between GarageCars and GarageArea is very high (0.88), and has very close correlation with the SalePrice. 
 - From total square feet of basement area (TotalBsmtSF) and first Floor square feet (1stFlrSF), we found 0.81 of correlation and same correlation with sale price (0.61).

You should always be concerned about the collinearity, regardless of the model/method being linear or not, or the main task being prediction or classification.

Assume a number of linearly correlated covariates/features present in the data set and Random Forest as the method. Obviously, random selection per node may pick only (or mostly) collinear features which may/will result in a poor split, and this can happen repeatedly, thus negatively affecting the performance.

140,"#### Identify  and treat multicollinearity:
**Multicollinearity** is more troublesome to detect because it emerges when three or more variables, which are highly correlated, are included within a model, leading to unreliable and unstable estimates of regression coefficients. To make matters worst multicollinearity can emerge even when isolated pairs of variables are not collinear.

To identify, we need start with the coefficient of determination, r<sup>2</sup>, is the square of the Pearson correlation coefficient r. The coefficient of determination, with respect to correlation, is the proportion of the variance that is shared by both variables. It gives a measure of the amount of variation that can be explained by the model (the correlation is the model). It is sometimes expressed as a percentage (e.g., 36% instead of 0.36) when we discuss the proportion of variance explained by the correlation. However, you should not write r<sup>2</sup> = 36%, or any other percentage. You should write it as a proportion (e.g., r<sup>2</sup> = 0.36).

Already the **Variance Inflation Factor** (**VIF**) is a measure of collinearity among predictor variables within a multiple regression.  It is may be calculated for each predictor by doing a linear regression of that predictor on all the other predictors, and then obtaining the R<sup>2</sup> from that regression.  It is calculated by taking the the ratio of the variance of all a given model's betas divide by the variance of a single beta if it were fit alone [1/(1-R<sup>2</sup>)]. Thus, a VIF of 1.8 tells us that the variance (the square of the standard error) of a particular coefficient is 80% larger than it would be if that predictor was completely uncorrelated with all the other predictors. The VIF has a lower bound of 1 but no upper bound. Authorities differ on how high the VIF has to be to constitute a problem (e.g.: 2.50 (R<sup>2</sup> equal to 0.6), sometimes 5 (R<sup>2</sup> equal to .8), or greater than 10 (R<sup>2</sup> equal to 0.9) and so on). 

But there are several situations in which multicollinearity can be safely ignored:

 - ***Interaction terms*** and ***higher-order terms*** (e.g., ***squared*** and ***cubed predictors***) ***are correlated*** with main effect terms because they include the main effects terms. **Ops!** Sometimes we use ***polynomials*** to solve problems, **indeed!** But keep calm, in these cases,  **standardizing** the predictors can **removed the multicollinearity**. 
 - ***Indicator***, like ***dummy*** or ***one-hot-encode***, that represent a ***categorical variable with three or more categories***. If the proportion of cases in the reference category is small, the indicator will necessarily have high VIF's, even if the categorical is not associated with other variables in the regression model. But, you need check if some dummy is collinear or has multicollinearity with other features outside of their dummies.
 - ***Control feature** if the ***feature of interest*** **do not have high VIF's**. Here's the thing about multicollinearity: it's only a problem for the features that are **collinear**. It increases the standard errors of their coefficients, and it may make those coefficients unstable in several ways. But so long as the collinear feature are only used as control feature, and they are not collinear with your feature of interest, there's no problem. The coefficients of the features of interest are not affected, and the performance of the control feature as controls is not impaired.

So, generally, we could run the same model twice, once with severe multicollinearity and once with moderate multicollinearity. This provides a great head-to-head comparison and it reveals the classic effects of multicollinearity. However, when standardizing your predictors doesn't work, you can try other solutions such as:
- removing highly correlated predictors
- linearly combining predictors, such as adding them together
- running entirely different analyses, such as partial least squares regression or principal components analysis

When considering a solution, keep in mind that all remedies have potential drawbacks. If you can live with less precise coefficient estimates, or a model that has a high R-squared but few significant predictors, doing nothing can be the correct decision because it won't impact the fit.

Given the potential for correlation among the predictors, we'll have display the variance inflation factors (VIF), which indicate the extent to which multicollinearity is present in a regression analysis. Hence such variables need to be removed from the model. Deleting one variable at a time and then again checking the VIF for the model is the best way to do this.

So, I start the analysis already having removed the features with he highest collinearities and run VIF.",markdown,,

148,"### Box cox transformation of highly skewed features
A Box Cox transformation is a way to transform non-normal data distribution into a normal shape. 
![image](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d1/9f/7c/d19f7c7f5daaed737ab2516decea9874.png)
Why does this matter?
- **Model bias and spurious interactions**: If you are performing a regression or any statistical modeling, this asymmetrical behavior may lead to a bias in the model. If a factor has a significant effect on the average, because the variability is much larger, many factors will seem to have a stronger effect when the mean is larger. This is not due, however, to a true factor effect but rather to an increased amount of variability that affects all factor effect estimates when the mean gets larger. This will probably generate spurious interactions due to a non-constant variation, resulting in a **very complex model** with many **spurious** and **unrealistic** interactions.
- **Normality is an important assumption for many statistical techniques**: such as individuals control charts, Cp/Cpk analysis, t-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA). A substantial departure from normality will bias your capability estimates.

One solution to this is to transform your data into normality using a [Box-Cox transformation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.boxcox.html) means that you are able to run a broader number of tests.

At the core of the Box Cox transformation is an exponent, lambda (λ), which varies from -5 to 5. All values of λ are considered and the optimal value for your data is selected; The 'optimal value' is the one which results in the best approximation of a normal distribution curve. The transformation of Y has the form:
<a href=""http://vitarts3.hospedagemdesites.ws/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/boxcox.png""><img src=""http://vitarts3.hospedagemdesites.ws/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/boxcox.png"" alt="""" width=""222"" height=""70"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-13940"" /></a>

The scipy implementation proceeded with this formula, then you need before take care of negatives values if you have. A common technique for handling negative values is to add a constant value to the data prior to applying the log transform. The transformation is therefore log(Y+a) where a is the constant. Some people like to choose a so that min(Y+a) is a very small positive number (like 0.001). Others choose a so that min(Y+a) = 1. For the latter choice, you can show that a = b – min(Y), where b is either a small number or is 1.
This test only works for positive data. However, Box and Cox did propose a second formula that can be used for negative y-values, not implemented in scipy:
<a href=""http://vitarts3.hospedagemdesites.ws/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/boxcoxNeg.png""><img src=""http://vitarts3.hospedagemdesites.ws/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/boxcoxNeg.png"" alt="""" width=""272"" height=""76"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-13941"" /></a>
The formula are deceptively simple. Testing all possible values by hand is unnecessarily labor intensive.

<p align='center'> Common Box-Cox Transformations 
</p>

| Lambda value (λ) | Transformed data (Y') |
|------------------|-----------------------|
|        -3	       | Y\*\*-3 = 1/Y\*\*3    |
|        -2        | Y\*\*-2 = 1/Y\*\*2    |
|        -1        | Y\*\*-1 = 1/Y         |
|       -0.5       | Y\*\*-0.5 = 1/(√(Y))  |
|         0        | log(Y)(\*)            |
|        0.5       | Y0.5 = √(Y)           |
|         1        | Y\*\*1 = Y            |
|         2        | Y\*\*2                |
|         3        | Y\*\*3                |

(\*)Note: the transformation for zero is log(0), otherwise all data would transform to Y\*\*0 = 1.

It is important to consider feature selection a part of the model selection process. If you do not, you may inadvertently introduce bias into your models which can result in overfitting.

Compare several feature selection methods, including your new idea, correlation coefficients, backward selection and embedded methods. Use linear and non-linear predictors. Select the best approach with model selection.

Feature selection methods can be used to identify and remove unneeded, irrelevant and redundant attributes from data that do not contribute to the accuracy of a predictive model or may in fact decrease the accuracy of the model.

All of the features we find in the dataset might not be useful in building a machine learning model to make the necessary prediction. Using some of the features might even make the predictions worse. 
![selectFeat](http://vitarts3.hospedagemdesites.ws/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Select_features.png)
Often in data science we have hundreds or even millions of features and we want a way to create a model that only includes the most important features. This has three benefits.

1. It reduces the variance of the model, and therefore overfitting.
2. It reduces the complexity of a model and makes it easier to interpret.
3. It improves the accuracy of a model if the right subset is chosen.
4.Finally, it reduces the computational cost (and time) of training a model.
So, an alternative way to reduce the complexity of the model and avoid overfitting is dimensionality reduction via feature selection, which is especially useful for unregularized models. There are two main categories of dimensionality reduction techniques: feature selection and feature extraction. Using feature selection, we select a subset of the original features. In feature extraction, we derive information from the feature set to construct a new feature subspace.
![image](http://www.bigdata-madesimple.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bigdata-knows-everything.jpg)
Exist various methodologies and techniques that you can use to subset your feature space and help your models perform better and efficiently. So, let's get started.",markdown,,
164,"### Prepare Data to Select Features
Let's create a data set, at first without applying our third-degree polymorph and already robust scaled.",markdown,,
165,"scale = RobustScaler()
# Data without Polynomials
df = pd.DataFrame(scale.fit_transform(train[cols]), columns= cols)",code,,
166,"### Wrapper Methods
In wrapper methods, we try to use a subset of features and train a model using them. Based on the inferences that we draw from the previous model, we decide to add or remove features from your subset. The problem is essentially reduced to a search problem. 
![image](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/0ecdaf_80b92d491f82441cb886f5787ea67f24.gif)

The two main disadvantages of these methods are : 
- The increasing overfitting risk when the number of observations is insufficient.
- These methods are usually computationally very expensive.

#### Backward Elimination
In backward elimination, we start with all the features and removes the least significant feature at each iteration which improves the performance of the model. We repeat this until no improvement is observed on removal of features.

We will see below row implementation of backward elimination, one to select by P-values and other based on the accuracy of a model the we submitted to it.

##### Backward Elimination By P-values

The **P-value**, or probability value, or asymptotic significance, is a **probability** value for a given **statistical model** that, ***if the null hypothesis is true***, a set of statistical observations more commonly known as **the statistical summary** <i>is greater than or equal in magnitude to</i> **the observed results**.

The **null hypothesis** is a general statement that **there is no relationship between two measured phenomena**.

For example, if the correlation is very small and furthermore, the p-value is high meaning that it is very likely to observe such correlation on a dataset of this size purely by chance.

But you need to be careful how you interpret the statistical significance of a correlation. If your correlation coefficient has been determined to be statistically significant this does not mean that you have a strong association. It simply tests the null hypothesis that there is no relationship. By rejecting the null hypothesis, you accept the alternative hypothesis that states that there is a relationship, but with no information about the strength of the relationship or its importance.

Since removal of different features from the dataset will have different effects on the p-value for the dataset, we can remove different features and measure the p-value in each case. These measured p-values can be used to decide whether to keep a feature or not.

From statsmodels.api, the [linear models](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/regression.html) allows estimation by ordinary least squares ([OLS](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/examples/notebooks/generated/ols.html)), weighted least squares ([WLS](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/examples/notebooks/generated/wls.html)), generalized least squares ([GLS](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/examples/notebooks/generated/gls.html)), and feasible generalized [recursive least squares](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/examples/notebooks/generated/recursive_ls.html) with autocorrelated AR(p) errors.

If you wish, switch from Remod to IsNew and see for yourself.

Something similar can be seen in relation to the total points segmented by the external condition, while we see that prices grow with the growth of the points, we see that although the external condition presents a small positive coefficient, the graph may be suggesting something different, but note that level 3 stands out at the beginning and around the mean, which would explain a small positive coefficient.

Also see that more important than basement conditions is its purpose in itself. Basements with living conditions present higher prices, curiously unfinished ones too, perhaps because they get the new owners to make them what they want.

As for the lot multiplied by the slope, as we already know we see the trend of price increase with lot size, but much variation, since other aspects influence the price as well as the slope itself.

Finally, the total of extra points, there is nothing new when we see that the bigger the better, segmented by the format of the lot, we see that the more regular the better it is, but if the terrain is unregulated the extra high score will not work.

174,"#### Select Features by Recursive Feature Elimination
The goal of [Recursive Feature Elimination](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFE.html) (RFE) is to select features by recursively considering smaller and smaller sets of features.

RFE is based on the idea to repeatedly construct a model and choose either the best or worst performing feature, setting the feature aside and then repeating the process with the rest of the features. This process is applied until all features in the dataset are exhausted. 

Other option is sequential Feature Selector (SFS) from mlxtend, a separate Python library that is designed to work well with scikit-learn, also provides a S that works a bit differently.

RFE is computationally less complex using the feature's weight coefficients (e.g., linear models) or feature importances (tree-based algorithms) to eliminate features recursively, whereas SFSs eliminate (or add) features based on a user-defined classifier/regression performance metric.

The scikit-learn has two implementations of RFE, let's see the [RFECV](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.RFECV.html#sklearn.feature_selection.RFECV) through a Lasso model to make the feature ranking with recursive feature elimination and cross-validated selection of the best number of features.

176,"#### Sequential feature selection

**Sequential feature selection algorithms** are a family of **greedy search algorithms** that are used to reduce an initial d-dimensional feature space to a k-dimensional feature subspace where k < d. The motivation behind feature selection algorithms is to automatically select a subset of features that are most relevant to the problem to improve computational efficiency or reduce the generalization error of the model by removing irrelevant features or noise, ***which can be useful for algorithms that don't support regularization***.

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each stage of a combinatorial search problem and generally yield a suboptimal solution to the problem in contrast to exhaustive search algorithms, which evaluate all possible combinations and are guaranteed to find the optimal solution. However, in practice, an exhaustive search is often computationally not feasible, whereas greedy algorithms allow for a less complex, computationally more efficient solution.

As you saw in the previous topic, RFE is computationally less complex using the feature weight coefficients (e.g., linear models) or feature importance (tree-based algorithms) to eliminate features recursively, whereas SFSs eliminate (or add) features based on a user-defined classifier/regression performance metric.

The SBS aims to reduce the dimensionality of the initial feature subspace with a minimum decay in performance of the regressor or classifier to improve upon computational efficiency. In certain cases, SBS can even improve the predictive power of the model if a model suffers from overfitting.

SBS sequentially removes features from the full feature subset until the new feature subspace contains the desired number of features. In order to determine which feature is to be removed at each stage, we need to define criterion function J that we want to minimize. The criterion calculated by the criterion function can simply be the difference in performance of the classifier after and before the removal of a particular feature. Then the feature to be removed at each stage can simply be defined as the feature that maximizes this criterion.

Filter methods use statistical methods for evaluation of a subset of features, they are generally used as a preprocessing step. These methods are also known as **univariate feature selection**, they examines each feature individually to determine the strength of the relationship of the feature with the dependent variable. These methods are **simple to run and understand** and are in general particularly **good for gaining a better understanding** of data, but **not necessarily for optimizing the feature set for better generalization**.

![image](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/boyfriend.png)

So, the features are selected on the basis of their scores in various statistical tests for their correlation with the outcome variable. The correlation is a subjective term here. For basic guidance, you can refer to the following table for defining correlation co-efficients.

| Feature/Response |       Continuous      | Categorical
|------------------|-----------------------|------------
| Continuous       | Pearson's Correlation | LDA
| Categorical      | Anova                 | Chi-Square

One thing that should be kept in mind is that filter methods do not remove multicollinearity. So, you must deal with multicollinearity of features as well before training models for your data.

There are lot of different options for univariate selection. Some examples are:
- Univariate feature selection
- Model Based Ranking",markdown,,
182,"#### Univariate feature selection
On scikit-learn we find variety of implementation oriented to regression tasks to select features according to the [k highest scores](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SelectKBest.html), see below some of that:
- [f_regression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.f_classif.html#sklearn.feature_selection.f_classif) The Pearson's Correlation are covert to F score then to a p-value. So, the selection is based on the F-value between label/feature for regression tasks.
- [mutual_info_regression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.mutual_info_regression.html#sklearn.feature_selection.mutual_info_regression) estimate mutual information for a continuous target variable. The MI between two random variables is a non-negative value, which measures the dependency between the variables. It is equal to zero if and only if two random variables are independent, and higher values mean higher dependency. The function relies on nonparametric methods based on entropy estimation from k-nearest neighbors distances.
![image](https://blogradiusagent.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/tenor.gif?w=770)

The methods based on F-test estimate the degree of linear dependency between two random variables. On the other hand, mutual information methods can capture any kind of statistical dependency, but being nonparametric, they require more samples for accurate estimation.

Other important point is if you use sparse data, for example if we continue consider hot-encode of some categorical data with largest number of distinct values, mutual_info_regression will deal with the data without making it dense.

2. Permutation Importance or Mean Decrease in Accuracy 
3. Permutation with Shadow Features
4. Gradient Boosting

Others models has concerns om **multicollinearity** problem and adding additional **constraints** or **penalty** to **regularize**. When there are multiple correlated features, as is the case with very many real life datasets, the model becomes unstable, meaning that small changes in the data can cause large changes in the model, making model interpretation very difficult on the regularization terms. 

This applies to regression models like LASSO and RIDGE. In classifier cases, you can use 'SGDClassifier' where you can set the loss parameter to 'log' for Logistic Regression or 'hinge' for 'SVM'. In 'SGDClassifier' you can set the penalty to either of 'l1', 'l2' or 'elasticnet' which is a combination of both.

Let's start with more details and examples:",markdown,,
185,"#### Feature Selection by Gradient Boosting
The LightGBM model the importance is calculated from, if 'split', result contains numbers of times the feature is used in a model, if 'gain', result contains total gains of splits which use the feature.

On the [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_api.html) model the importance is calculated by:
- 'weight': the number of times a feature is used to split the data across all trees.
- 'gain': the average gain across all splits the feature is used in.
- 'cover': the average coverage across all splits the feature is used in.
- 'total_gain': the total gain across all splits the feature is used in.
- 'total_cover': the total coverage across all splits the feature is used in.

First measure is split-based and is very similar with the one given by for Gini Importance. But it doesn't take the number of samples into account.

The second measure is gain-based. It's basically the same as the Gini Importance implemented in R packages and in scikit-learn with Gini impurity replaced by the objective used by the gradient boosting model.

The cover, implemented exclusively in XGBoost, is counting the number of samples affected by the splits based on a feature.

get_score(fmap='', importance_type='weight')
Get feature importance of each feature. Importance type can be defined as:

The default measure of both XGBoost and LightGBM is the split-based one. I think this measure will be problematic if there are one or two feature with strong signals and a few features with weak signals. The model will exploit the strong features in the first few trees and use the rest of the features to improve on the residuals. The strong features will look not as important as they actually are. While setting lower learning rate and early stopping should alleviate the problem, also checking gain-based measure may be a good idea.

Note that these measures are purely calculated using training data, so there's a chance that a split creates no improvement on the objective in the holdout set. This problem is more severe than in the random forest since gradient boosting models are more prone to over-fitting. 

Feature importance scores can be used for feature selection in scikit-learn.

This is done using the SelectFromModel class that takes a model and can transform a dataset into a subset with selected features.

This class can take a previous trained model, such as one trained on the entire training dataset. It can then use a threshold to decide which features to select. This threshold is used when you call the transform() method on the SelectFromModel instance to consistently select the same features on the training dataset and the test dataset.",markdown,,

### PCA
**Principal component analysis** ([PCA](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html)) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. If there are n observations with p variables, then the number of distinct principal components is `min(n-1,p)`. This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance, and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to the preceding components. The resulting vectors are an uncorrelated orthogonal basis set. PCA is sensitive to the relative scaling of the original variables.

First, we start to looking at different approaches to implement linear regression models, and use hyper parametrization, cross validation and compare the results between different erros measures.

### Model Hyper Parametrization
#### Evaluate Results
**Mean Squared Error ([MSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error))**

In statistics, MSE or mean squared deviation (MSD) of an estimator measures the average of the squares of the errors. MSE is a risk function, corresponding to the expected value of the squared error loss. The fact that MSE is almost always strictly positive (and not zero) is because of randomness or because the estimator does not account for information that could produce a more accurate estimate.
![image.png](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e258221518869aa1c6561bb75b99476c4734108e)
Which is simply the average value of the SSE cost function that we minimize to fit the linear regression model. The MSE is useful to for comparing different regression models or for tuning their parameters via a grid search and cross-validation.

**Root-Mean-Square Error ([RMSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation))**

The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) or root-mean-square error (RMSE) is a frequently used measure of the differences between values predicted by a model or an estimator and the values observed. 
![image.png](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/6d689379d70cd119e3a9ed3c8ae306cafa5d516d)

**Mean Absolute Error ([MAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_error))**

In statistics, mean absolute error (MAE) is a measure of difference between two continuous variables, is also the average horizontal distance between each point and the identity line.

Which can be understood as a standardized version of the MSE, for better [interpretability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXiLXjv02XY) of the model performance (try to say that tree times and faster!). In other words, R<sup>2</sup> is the fraction of response variance that is captured by the model.

The plot of differences or vertical distances between the actual and predicted values. Commonly used graphical analysis for diagnosing regression models to detect nonlinearity and outliers, and to check if the errors are randomly distributed.
![image.png](https://i1.wp.com/condor.depaul.edu/sjost/it223/documents/resid-plots.gif)
Some points for help you in your analysis:
- Since `Residual = Observed – Predicted` ***positive values*** for the residual (on the y-axis) mean the ***prediction was too low***, and ***negative values*** mean the ***prediction was too high***; 0 means the guess was exactly correct.

- ***They're pretty symmetrically distributed, tending to cluster towards the middle of the plot.***

    <p>For a good regression model, we would expect that the errors are randomly distributed and the residuals should be randomly scattered around the centerline. <p>
    
- ***Detect outliers, which are represented by the points with a large deviation from the centerline.***

    Now, you might be wondering how large a residual has to be before a data point should be flagged as being an outlier. The answer is not straightforward, since the magnitude of the residuals depends on the units of the response variable. That is, if your measurements are made in pounds, then the units of the residuals are in pounds. And, if your measurements are made in inches, then the units of the residuals are in inches. Therefore, there is no one ""rule of thumb"" that we can define to flag a residual as being exceptionally unusual.

    There's a solution to this problem. We can make the residuals **unitless**by dividing them by their standard deviation. In this way we create what are called **standardized residuals**. They tell us how many standard deviations above — if positive — or below — if negative — a data point is from the estimated regression line. <p>
    
- ***They're clustered around the lower single digits of the y-axis (e.g., 0.5 or 1.5, not 30 or 150).***

    Again, doesn't exist a unique rule for all cases. But, recall that the empirical rule tells us that, for data that are normally distributed, 95% of the measurements fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean. Therefore, any observations with a standardized residual greater than 2 or smaller than -2 might be flagged for further investigation. It is important to note that by using this ""greater than 2, smaller than -2 rule,"" approximately 5% of the measurements in a data set will be flagged even though they are perfectly fine. It is in your best interest not to treat this rule of thumb as a cut-and-dried, believe-it-to-the-bone, hard-and fast rule! So, in most cases it may be more practical to investigate further any observations with a standardized residual greater than 3 or smaller than -3. Using the empirical rule we would expect only 0.2% of observations to fall into this category.<p>
    
- ***If we see patterns in a residual plot, it means that our model is unable to capture some explanatory information.***

    A special case is  any systematic (non-random) pattern. It is sufficient to suggest that the regression function is not linear. For example, if the residuals depart from 0 in some systematic manner, such as being positive for small x values, negative for medium x values, and positive again for large x values. <p>
    
- ***Non-constant error variance shows up on a residuals vs. fits (or predictor) plot in any of the following ways:***
    - The plot has a ""fanning"" effect. That is, the residuals are close to 0 for small x values and are more spread out for large x values.
    - The plot has a ""funneling"" effect. That is, the residuals are spread out for small x values and close to 0 for large x values.
    - Or, the spread of the residuals in the residuals vs. fits plot varies in some complex fashion.",markdown,,

198,"### Model Hiperparametrization
#### Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator)
[Lasso](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Lasso.html) was introduced in order to improve the prediction accuracy and interpretability of regression models by include a with L1 prior as regularizer and altering the model fitting process to select only a subset of the provided covariates for use in the final model rather than using all of them. [Lasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)) was originally formulated for least squares models and this simple case reveals a substantial amount about the behavior of the estimator, including its relationship to ridge regression and best subset selection and the connections between Lasso coefficient estimates and so-called soft thresholding. It also reveals that the coefficient estimates need not be unique if covariates are collinear.

Prior to lasso, the most widely used method for choosing which covariates to include was stepwise selection, which only improves prediction accuracy in certain cases, such as when only a few covariates have a strong relationship with the outcome. However, in other cases, it can make prediction error worse. Also, at the time, ridge regression was the most popular technique for improving prediction accuracy. Ridge regression improves prediction error by shrinking large regression coefficients in order to reduce overfitting, but it does not perform covariate selection and therefore does not help to make the model more interpretable.

Lasso is able to achieve both of these goals by forcing the sum of the absolute value of the regression coefficients to be less than a fixed value, which depending on the regularization strength, certain weights can become zero, which makes the Lasso also useful as a supervised feature selection technique, by effectively choosing a simpler model that does not include those coefficients. However, a limitation of the Lasso is that it selects at most n variables if m > n.

This idea is similar to ridge regression, in which the sum of the squares of the coefficients is forced to be less than a fixed value, though in the case of ridge regression, this only shrinks the size of the coefficients, it does not set any of them to zero.

The optimization objective for Lasso is: `(1 / (2 * n_samples)) * ||y - Xw||^2_2 + alpha * ||w||_1`

Technically the Lasso model is optimizing the same objective function as the Elastic Net with `l1_ratio=1.0`,  no L2 penalty.

This characteristics turn Lasso a interesting alternative approach that can lead to sparse models.

From sklearn its most important parameters are: 
- alpha: Constant that multiplies the L1 term. Defaults to 1.0. alpha = 0 is equivalent to an ordinary least square, solved by the LinearRegression object. For numerical reasons, using alpha = 0 with the Lasso object is not advised. Given this, you should use the LinearRegression object.
- max_iter: The maximum number of iterations
- selection: If set to 'random', a random coefficient is updated every iteration rather than looping over features sequentially by default. This (setting to 'random') often leads to significantly faster convergence especially when tol is higher than 1e-4.
- tol: The tolerance for the optimization: if the updates are smaller than tol, the optimization code checks the dual gap for optimality and continues until it is smaller than tol.

So, I run many times my model, with different parameters, selection features, reduction or not and with and without log1P transformation of Sales Price.

From the residuals plot with log sales price:
We saw that most are plot randomly scattered around the centerline. You can think that some outliers that we didn't remove it can be detect! Are they the points with a large deviation from the centerline, the most extern points? However, notice that our deviation s no grater the 0.42 and no below to -0.8, they're clustered around the lower single digits of the y-axis. 

In general, there aren't any clear patterns, but with more attention we can observe some patterns in a few points, it means that our model is unable to capture some explanatory information, but as you can see, it is not easy to solve then. Maybe other model, or stack models or some feature that we drooped can help?

In addition, the log transformation is also used to handle cases where the expected distribution of the dependent variable leads to a funnel-like residue plot. Note that our residue plot without the log actually has a slight funnel look, but note that the model was trained and validated with the log transformation of the sales prices. So the transformation actually dealt with the problem of the distribution of the variable, but seems to have had little effect on the deviations of the residual

So, you could decide to cut some of these outliers, or simply go ahead and believe that your model is performing well and that the transformation in log1P of the selling price was successful. But calm, as you can see from the chart of errors on the right, things are not quite like that.

In fact I have seen many books and some colleagues do just that, turn the dependent variable into something like log, check for QQ testing that there has been improvement by reversing it to normal distribution, plotting errors and cutting or moving on believing it to be correct, but when you has applied a transformation on your response variable it is recommended that you reverse it when evaluating the errors, and this is what we did in the right chart.

So you can see that the residues have a pattern, curiously linear. and is more clear to see some outliers that really important to drop.

So you see, this confirms that this does not mean that anyone using log1p has failed, but shows that without the help of the residuals plot and the use of standardized metrics, it would be very difficult to identify these 23 outliers, more still decide to cut them, as well as require more tests to confirm the model.

So what we have just seen is another procedure for identifying and cutting outliers with the intention of improving the performance and generalization of the model. However, this procedure has to be taken care of; in addition, we might not have done it now, but the one left for a final stage where we would have already selected the model or built our stacked model. Thus, we do not run the risk of excluding observations that are outliers in this model, but which may be treated in another. Remember that the main outliers, the most damaging, had already been identified and eliminated in the EDA phase.

211,"####  Gradient Boosting Regressor
Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees. It builds the model in a stage-wise fashion like other boosting methods do, and it generalizes them by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function.

On the [sklearn implementation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor.html), in each stage a regression tree is fit on the negative gradient of the given loss function. Its most important parameters are:
- loss: loss function to be optimized. 'ls' refers to least squares regression. 'lad' (least absolute deviation) is a highly robust loss function solely based on order information of the input variables. 'huber' is a combination of the two. 'quantile' allows quantile regression (use alpha to specify the quantile).
- learning_rate: learning rate shrinks the contribution of each tree by learning_rate. There is a trade-off between learning_rate and n_estimators.
- n_estimators: The number of boosting stages to perform. Gradient boosting is fairly robust to over-fitting so a large number usually results in better performance.
- criterion: The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria are 'friedman_mse' for the mean squared error with improvement score by Friedman, 'mse' for mean squared error, and 'mae' for the mean absolute error. The default value of 'friedman_mse' is generally the best as it can provide a better approximation in some cases.
- min_samples_split: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:
- min_samples_leaf: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node. A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at least min_samples_leaf training samples in each of the left and right branches. This may have the effect of smoothing the model, especially in regression.
- max_depth: maximum depth of the individual regression estimators. The maximum depth limits the number of nodes in the tree. Tune this parameter for best performance; the best value depends on the interaction of the input variables.
- alpha: The alpha-quantile of the huber loss function and the quantile loss function. Only if loss='huber' or loss='quantile'.
- tol: Tolerance for the early stopping. When the loss is not improving by at least tol for n_iter_no_change iterations (if set to a number), the training stops.",markdown,,

214,"#### ElasticNet
In statistics and, in particular, in the fitting of linear or logistic regression models, the elastic net is a regularized regression method that linearly combines the L1 and L2 penalties of the lasso and ridge methods.
The elastic net method overcomes the limitations of the Lasso method which uses a penalty function based on
![image](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/5a188f4b162086fb06a4485f3336baefc22e18b3)
Use of this penalty function has several limitations. For example, in the 'large p, small n' case (high-dimensional data with few examples, what has looked like this case), the Lasso selects at most n variables before it saturates. Also if there is a group of highly correlated variables, then the Lasso tends to select one variable from a group and ignore the others. To overcome these limitations, the elastic net adds a quadratic part to the penalty. The estimates from the elastic net method are defined by:
![image](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/a66c7bfcf201d515eb71dd0aed5c8553ce990b6e)
- Has a L1 penalty to generate sparsity. if we set l1_ratio to 1.0, the ElasticNet regressor would be equal to Lasso regression. Currently, l1_ratio <= 0.01 is not reliable, unless you supply your own sequence of alpha.
- alpha: Constant that multiplies the penalty terms. 
- Has a L2 penalty to overcome some of the limitations of the Lasso, such as the number of selected variables.
- The quadratic penalty term makes the loss function strictly convex, and it therefore has a unique minimum. 

On [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.ElasticNet.html), if you are interested in controlling the L1 and L2 penalty separately, keep in mind that this is equivalent to::

        a * L1 + b * L2    where:  alpha = a + b and l1_ratio = a / (a + b)
        
Its most important parameters are:
- alpha: Constant that multiplies the penalty terms. Defaults to 1.0. See the notes for the exact mathematical meaning of this parameter.``alpha = 0`` is equivalent to an ordinary least square, solved by the LinearRegression object. For numerical reasons, using alpha = 0 with the Lasso object is not advised. Given this, you should use the LinearRegression object.
- l1_ratio: The ElasticNet mixing parameter, with 0 <= l1_ratio <= 1. For l1_ratio = 0 the penalty is an L2 penalty. For l1_ratio = 1 it is an L1 penalty. For 0 < l1_ratio < 1, the penalty is a combination of L1 and L2.
- max_iter: The maximum number of iterations
- selection: If set to 'random', a random coefficient is updated every iteration rather than looping over features sequentially by default. This (setting to 'random') often leads to significantly faster convergence especially when tol is higher than 1e-4.

![image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*jgWOhDiGjVp-NCSPa5abmg.png)
By increasing the value of the hyper parameter λ , we increase the regularization strength and shrink the weights of our model. Please note that we don't regularize the intercept term ß<sub>0,/sub>.

Bayesian ridge regression fit a Bayesian ridge model and optimize the regularization parameters lambda (precision of the weights) and alpha (precision of the noise).

The advantages of Bayesian Regression are:
- It adapts to the data at hand.
- It can be used to include regularization parameters in the estimation procedure.
The disadvantages of Bayesian regression include:
- Inference of the model can be time consuming.

220,"#### Linear Regression
In statistics, ordinary least squares (OLS) is a type of linear least squares method for estimating the unknown parameters in a linear regression model. OLS chooses the parameters of a linear function of a set of explanatory variables by the principle of least squares: minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed dependent variable (values of the variable being predicted) in the given dataset and those predicted by the linear function.

On sklearn the ordinary least squares are implemented as [LinearRegression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html), and its main important parameters are:
- fit_intercept: whether to calculate the intercept for this model. If set to False, no intercept will be used in calculations (e.g. data is expected to be already centered).
- normalize: This parameter is ignored when fit_intercept is set to False. If True, the regressors X will be normalized before regression by subtracting the mean and dividing by the l2-norm. If you wish to standardize, please use sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler before calling fit on an estimator with normalize=False.",markdown,,

226,"#### Robust Regressor
In robust statistics, robust regression is a form of regression analysis designed to overcome some limitations of traditional parametric and non-parametric methods. Regression analysis seeks to find the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable. Certain widely used methods of regression, such as ordinary least squares, have favourable properties if their underlying assumptions are true, but can give misleading results if those assumptions are not true; thus ordinary least squares is said to be not robust to violations of its assumptions. Robust regression methods are designed to be not overly affected by violations of assumptions by the underlying data-generating process.

In particular, least squares estimates for regression models are highly sensitive to (i.e. not robust against) outliers. While there is no precise definition of an outlier, outliers are observations which do not follow the pattern of the other observations. This is not normally a problem if the outlier is simply an extreme observation drawn from the tail of a normal distribution, but if the outlier results from non-normal measurement error or some other violation of standard ordinary least squares assumptions, then it compromises the validity of the regression results if a non-robust regression technique is used.

From the sklearn the [HuberRegressor](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.HuberRegressor.html#sklearn.linear_model.HuberRegressor) implements a robust regressor strategy. The HuberRegressor is different to Ridge because it applies a linear loss to samples that are classified as outliers. A sample is classified as an inlier if the absolute error of that sample is lesser than a certain threshold. It differs from TheilSenRegressor and RANSACRegressor because it does not ignore the effect of the outliers but gives a lesser weight to them.

Its main parameters are:
- epsilon: The parameter epsilon controls the number of samples that should be classified as outliers. The smaller the epsilon, the more robust it is to outliers.
- max_iter: Maximum number of iterations that scipy.optimize.fmin_l_bfgs_b should run for.
- alpha: Regularization parameter.
- tol: The iteration will stop when `max{|proj g_i | i = 1, ..., n} <= tol` where pg_i is the i-th component of the projected gradient.",markdown,,

231,"#### SGD Regressor
Linear model fitted by minimizing a regularized empirical loss with SGD

Stochastic gradient descent (often shortened to SGD), also known as incremental gradient descent, is an iterative method for optimizing a differentiable objective function, a stochastic approximation of gradient descent optimization. The gradient of the loss is estimated each sample at a time and the model is updated along the way with a decreasing strength schedule (aka learning rate).

The regularizer is a penalty added to the loss function that shrinks model parameters towards the zero vector using either the squared euclidean norm L2 or the absolute norm L1 or a combination of both (Elastic Net). If the parameter update crosses the 0.0 value because of the regularizer, the update is truncated to 0.0 to allow for learning sparse models and achieve online feature selection.

This implementation works with data represented as dense numpy arrays of floating point values for the features.

The main [parameters](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor.html) are:
- loss: The loss function to be used. The 'squared_loss' refers to the ordinary least squares fit. 'huber' modifies 'squared_loss' to focus less on getting outliers correct by switching from squared to linear loss past a distance of epsilon. 'epsilon_insensitive' ignores errors less than epsilon and is linear past that; this is the loss function used in SVR. 'squared_epsilon_insensitive' is the same but becomes squared loss past a tolerance of epsilon.
- penalty: The penalty (aka regularization term) to be used. Defaults to 'l2' which is the standard regularizer for linear SVM models. 'l1' and 'elasticnet' might bring sparsity to the model (feature selection) not achievable with 'l2'.
- alpha: Constant that multiplies the regularization term. Defaults to 0.0001 Also used to compute learning_rate when set to 'optimal'.
- l1_ratio: The Elastic Net mixing parameter, with 0 <= l1_ratio <= 1. l1_ratio=0 corresponds to L2 penalty, l1_ratio=1 to L1. Defaults to 0.15.
- max_iter: The maximum number of passes over the training data (aka epochs). It only impacts the behavior in the fit method, and not the partial_fit. Defaults to 1000 from 0.21 version, or if tol is not None.
- tol: The stopping criterion. If it is not None, the iterations will stop when (loss > previous_loss - tol). Defaults to 1e-3 from 0.21 version.
- epsilon: Epsilon in the epsilon-insensitive loss functions; only if loss is 'huber', 'epsilon_insensitive', or 'squared_epsilon_insensitive'. For 'huber', determines the threshold at which it becomes less important to get the prediction exactly right. For epsilon-insensitive, any differences between the current prediction and the correct label are ignored if they are less than this threshold.
- eta0: The initial learning rate for the 'constant', 'invscaling' or 'adaptive' schedules. The default value is 0.0 as eta0 is not used by the default schedule 'optimal'.
- power_t:The exponent for inverse scaling learning rate. Default 0.5.
- learning_rate: The learning rate schedule:
  - 'constant': eta = eta0
  - 'optimal': eta = 1.0 / (alpha * (t + t0)) where t0 is chosen by a heuristic proposed by Leon Bottou.
  - 'invscaling': eta = eta0 / pow(t, power_t)
  - 'adaptive': eta = eta0, as long as the training keeps decreasing. Each time n_iter_no_change consecutive epochs fail to decrease the training loss by tol or fail to increase validation score by tol if early_stopping is True, the current learning rate is divided by 5.

As we can see, through a method we were able to generate models that could present good generalization and better performance when combined.

The big challenge was the proper detection and decision-cutting of outliers, the reassessment of noise-generating features, and the combined combination of selection and data engineering strategies.

We can put into practice a great number of techniques and methods, from EDA to the generation of stacked models, covering a broad conceptual and practical expectation as desired.

If you run this kernel as it is and submit the file, you will be able to be among the top 34.7% with 0.12559 points, but as you noted, we had to make decisions that impacted the performance better or worse depending on the characteristics of each model . In this sense, I invite you to download this notebook and practice it, send your suggestions and comments, knowing that it is possible to be among the top 16%.

For next steps, I suggest:
- Applies it to a deep learning model like TensorFlow
- Try a Random Forest Regressor, with and without the transformations like box cox and without polynomials.
- Try eliminate outliers only through the residuals
- Try find a good model with Sales price on log1p transformation
- Run some models without polynomials and try other combinations of polynomials, with more and less features
- Apply BboxCox on others features, and try boxcox1p with different lambdas
- Some categorical data has better performance if you ignore that it is categorical. Since this is a wrong approach, you need find than empirical and try give some meaning, if you really can.

Thank you for your attention so far, I also ask you to share and accept any comments and feedback.

My best regards and good luck.",markdown,,
