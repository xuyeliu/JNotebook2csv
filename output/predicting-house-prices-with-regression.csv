Hi! If you read my previous [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/samsonqian/titanic-guide-with-sklearn-and-eda) of predicting survivors of the Titanic, you saw a thorough guide of EDA, visualization, and classification. This kernel is going to be about another kind of Supervised Machine Learning, regression, where we predict numeric values (house price) instead of categories (survived/didn't survive). This guide will go more in depth of data preprocessing and modelling, because the data set we will work with is much larger and complex than the Titanic data. Let's get started! 

*Please upvote if this kernel helps you! Feel free to fork this notebook to play with the code yourself.* If you may have any questions about the code, or any step of the process, please comment and I will clear up any confusion.",markdown,,
1,"My next kernel will be about Deep Learning and Neural Networks, so please follow me and stay tuned for that!",markdown,,
2,"## Classification vs. Regression
The problem we are dealing with in this kernel is predicting house prices from features of the house (ie. how many rooms it has). Because we are trying to predict a continuous value instead of a binary value (ie. Titanic survivors), this is a regression problem.

# 3. Imputing Null Values
With data this large, it is not surprising that there are a lot of missing values in the cells. In order to effectively train our model we build, we must first deal with the missing values. There are missing values for both numerical and categorical data. We will see how to deal with both.

For numerical imputing, we would typically fill the missing values with a measure like median, mean, or mode. For categorical imputing, I chose to fill the missing values with the most common term that appeared from the entire column. There are other ways to do the imputing though, and I ecnourage you to test out your own creative ways!",markdown,,

If you look at the data description file provided, you will see that for some categories, NaN actually means something.

Now that we've preprocessed and explored our data, we have a much better understanding of the type of data that we're dealing with. Now, we can began to build and test different models for regression to predict the Sale Price of each house. We will import these models, train them, and evaluate them.
